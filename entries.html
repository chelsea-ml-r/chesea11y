    <h2 id="entry-2">Orange Shirt Day</h2>
    <p>Composed September 30, 2024</p>
    
    <h3>Introduction</h3>
    <p>The following is a personal reflection on the nature of <a href="https://unsettlingamerica.wordpress.com/2014/06/06/settler-colonialism-primer/">settler colonialism</a>, <a href="https://www.haymarketbooks.org/blogs/174-racial-capitalism-a-reading-list">racial capitalism</a>, and those two structures' relationship to digital accessibility. I'm doing this because it's the <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/canadian-heritage/campaigns/national-day-truth-reconciliation.html">National Day for Truth and Reconciliation</a>, or colloquialy, 'Orange Shirt Day.' It's a contemplative holidary where the nation nominally recognizes the legacy of residential schools and nominally honours residential school survivors.</p>

    <h3>A Primer on Residential Schools</h3>
    <p>Now, this is a public post, so I am obligated to give some context here. As a settler-colonial state, canada naturally wants to get rid of its Indigneous peoples and has pursued this objective variously throughout the course of history. This logic of elimination is fundamentally connected to the nature of settler-colonial ventures: unlike 'traditional' colonies where the native population is used as labour to support the needs of the metropol, settler colonies depend on the elimination of the native population in order to gain complete control of the natural resources that the native population has the first claim to. As long as 'canada' continues to exclude the rights of Indigenous peoples to their land and continues to enforce corrupted treaties that were drafted with this logic of elimination in mind, this fundamental tendency to create new systems to eliminate the Indigenous populations will persist.</p>
    <p>The residential schools were one such system. Nowadays, they are viewed as a system that was exceptionally evil. This is because they found hundreds of dead bodies of children in unmarked graves underneath many of these residential school sites. Settler like me hear about this, and they can't cope with the idea that their own nation could have done this. So in narrativizing the event, they often suggest that there was something potentially super evil about the pastors and nuns that were charged with these so-called schools. The truth is actually more scary than that.</p>
    <p>Residential schools were only one manifestation of many kinds of banal institutions that were built to eliminate Indigenous people from public life. There were others. Indian TB hospitals. Day school. Jails and prisons. Mental hospitals. Institutions for 'the feeble and infirm.' And in the modern day, the Child Welfare system/foster homes, hospitals, mental hospitals, continue this legacy. Truly horrific things continue to happen in these public sectors. In the private sectors, many non-profits also unwittingly use practices that facilitate the logic of elimination. And the state continues to absorb the land and resources of Indigenous peoples who are disabled by these systems.</p> 

    <h3>When Two Oppressions Interlace</h3>

    <p>Yes, you may have forgot that I am talking about disability and A11Y here. For Indigenous peoples struggling against a settler colonial state, the experience itself can be incredibly disabling. The rate of disability is much higher amongst Indigenous population than the white settler population. The Indigenous population also has a much higher occurance of poverty than the white settler population does.</p>

    <p>The <a href="https://www.internetsocietymanitoba.ca/northendconnect/">digital divide</a> has already been identified as a key problem area that reinforces inequality. Even if they have regular access to devices, lots of folks in the inner city (predominantly Indigenous people and refugees) do not have access to good internet infrastructure. Many folks who do not have this are restricted to using computers at libraries and drop-ins. They are often restricted by time-limits and content blockers. Many of them don't have assistive technology loaded onto the devices. When it's a public device, personalization options are limited. The digital literacy that many people who grow up in these conditions have tends to be lower than the mainstream, compounding the problem. Sometimes, these marginalized folks are <a href="https://winnspace.uwinnipeg.ca/handle/10680/1911">denied entry at libraries</a> and drop-ins.</p>
    
    <h3>So What Now?</h3>
    <p>Here's where I abandon the illusion of expertise and fully admit that I don't have a good solution to give to a11y professionals who want to be able to advocate for Disabled Indigenous people, poor Disabled people, poor Disabled Indigenous people, and unhoused poor Disabled Indigenous people. Here are some ideas that I have, but I'm not Indigenous and I'm not an expert in digital accessibility. This is mostly here so I can measure my knowledge in a year from now:</p>
    
    <ul>
      <li>Emphasize performance and efficiency. Do all the caching and lazy rendering tricks, progressive enhancement, no blocking assets, all the tricks to get that number down with the experience still enjoyable. Especially for websites that provide social services, go all in, more than you would otherwise.</li>
      <li>Offering script-based text customization options (like those found in horrid accessibility overlays) might actually not be a bad idea, offering personalization options to those who might not have the ability to do so otherwise.</li>
      <li>Test on older OS and technology.</li>
      <li>Ensure your content can be printed gracefully.</li>
      <li>When designing account creation options, omit or make optional a physical mailing address and/or telephone number, unless it is absolutely necessary.</li>
      <li>Provide discounted and/or free work to Indigenous organizations as you can afford to.</li>
      <li>Do not provide services to organizations that profit from undermining Indigenous land rights.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Conclusion</h3>
    <p>Crip activism has the key axiom: We don't leave anybody behind. As the field of digital accessibility gets more formalized and we see it becoming more part of the natural neoliberal order of things, let's keep this in mind.</p>

    <h2 id="entry-1">Problematic WCAG 2.1 Criterion</h2>
    <p>Composed September 9, 2024</p>

    <h3>Introduction</h3>

    <p>What aspects of <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/">WCAG 2.1</a> have the potential to be problematic? Currently, WCAG 2.1 is the draft mandated for implementation <a href="https://accessibilitymb.ca/accessibility/act-standards/the-accessibility-standard-for-information-and-communication.html">in my province</a>. Despite it not being the most recent version of the guidelines, 2.1 is the version most relevant to me. In answering the question, let's start with an obvious approach: What did <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/">WCAG 2.2</a> intervene on?</p>

    <h3>WCAG 2.2 Revisions</h3>

    <p>WCAG 2.2 was historic in that it was the first edition of the guidelines to <a href="https://www.boia.org/blog/why-wcag-2.2-isnt-fully-backwards-compatible-with-wcag-2.1">NOT be entirely backwards-compatible.</a> One criterion, Focus Visible, was shifted from level AA to level A. Additionally, <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#parsing">4.1.1 Parsing</a>, was removed from the guidelines.</p>

    <h4>Problematic Criteria: Focus Visible</h4>

    <p>The shift of <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/focus-visible.html">Focus Visible</a> from <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/conformance.html#uc-levels-head">Conformance Level AA to Conformance Level A</a> is intuitive. A visible focus indicator is essential for folks who use the keyboard to access the webpage along with their own vision. In my accessibility testing, when focus is not visible, I have to rely on the tiny link address that my Firefox or Chrome browser provides me in the bottom left corner.</p> 

    <!--<img src="link-address-bottom-left.png" alt="A red arrow points to the imperceptible link address on the bottom left for a highlighted link.">-->
    
    <p>Link addresses are for computers, not humans. They are not intended to be used as component that a human uses to understand where they are on the page. Additionally, when the focus indicator is visible in one section, but not in another, it is incredibly disorienting to shift my eyes to search for where I might possibly be on the page. It forces me to tab back and forth just to find my footing. Though I am not a native keyboard-only user, I would imagine that this consistently popping up would be exasperating.</p> 

    <h4> Problematic Criteria: Parsing</h4>

    <p>The deprecation of <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/parsing.html">Parsing</a> is the result of technological advances for assistive technology, and browsers in general. These tools are now expected to be able to smoothly handle some markup mistakes with no change in user experience. While proper HTML remains a priority, it no longer breaks functionality and is no longer considered absolutely necessary to create an accessible end product. Especially where the WCAG are used as a reference to pursue legal action, the inclusion of this criteria as 'essential' simply becomes inaccurate.</p>

    <h3>WCAG 2.2 Additions</h3>

    <p>In addition to existing features that WCAG 2.2 upgraded/downgraded, let's look at the new criteria that were introduced in order to find some the problematic elements of 2.1 that WCAG 2.2 sought to address.</p>

    <h4>Extra Problematic Criteria: Focus Visible</h4>

    <p>Three new success criteria pertaining to the focus indicator were added into WCAG 2.2: <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/focus-not-obscured-minimum.html">2.4.11 Focus Not Obscured (Minimum) (AA)</a>, <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/focus-not-obscured-enhanced.html">2.4.12 Focus Not Obscured (Enhanced) (AAA)</a>, and <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/focus-appearance.html">2.4.13 Focus Appearance (AAA)</a>. Within WCAG 2.1, 'Focus Visible', then listed as a Level AA element, merely outlined what the appearance of the focus indicator was. It had to not be transparent. It had to exist! However the wording of the criterion did not specify that the user actually had to <em>see</em> the indicator. If it was obscured by other elements, that was not a problem. In which case, it was possible to meet the definition of 'Focus Visible' without being able to see the focus!</p>

    <h4>Problematic Criteria: Pointer Gestures and Motion Actuation</h4>

    <p>Another success criterion new to WCAG 2.2, <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/dragging-movements.html">2.5.7 Dragging Movements (AA)</a>, reveals a gap within the original 2.1 guidelines. Dragging movements done by a mouse are not covered by the criterion in WCAG 2.1. For example, <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/motion-actuation">2.5.4 Motion Actuation</a>, which asks that "functionality that can be operated by device motion or user motion" can be disabled refers not to motion of the pointer. Examples of 'device motion' and 'user motion' include shaking the device, tilting the device, and touch gestures like swiping to get to the next. Another criteria, <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/pointer-gestures">2.5.1 Pointer Gestures (A)</a>, also does not address dragging motions. Pointer Gestures calls for making what is called 'path-based gestures' optional. Here's how W3C makes the distinction between 'path-based gestures' and dragging.</p>

    <blockquote cite="https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/pointer-gestures.html">
      Dragging is a movement where the user picks up an object with a pointer (such as mouse cursor or a finger) and moves it to some other position. This movement from start point to end point does not require the user to follow any particular path or direction. Dragging is therefore not path-based. In contrast, a path-based pointer gesture requires the traversal of an intermediate point, which is a technical way of expressing that the directionality and possibly speed of the gesture communicates a particular command to the system. Dragging motions are covered in Success Criterion 2.5.7: Dragging.
    </blockquote>
  
  <p>In plainer language, dragging and path-based motions both have a designated 'starting point' and 'ending point. But path-based requires you to take a designated route between these two areas, while dragging motions allow the user to get from the start to the end however they want.</p>

  <p>While there are assistive technologies that help users complete dragging motions, actually executing the movement is a <a href="https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-comments-wcag20/2024Jan/0000.html">cumbersome and complicated operation</a>. It also appears that the inclusion of dragging functionality is not always the default for some of these devices.</p>

  <h4>Problematic Criterion: Target Size</h4>

  <p>Also new to WCAG 2.2 was <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/target-size-minimum.html">2.5.8 Target Size (Minimum) (AA)</a>, a 'minimum' requirement that joined the Level AAA criteria <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/target-size">2.5.5 Target Size</a>, previously the only criterion that specified anything about target size. By target size, we mean whatever a person could click to change something on the page. These targets can be links, buttons, checkboxes, etc.</p> 

  <p>The problematic thing here is that Target Size was designated at a Level AAA criterion. There is no enforcement for Level AAA criteria, and they are not seen as a priority at all. It was designated as such because the original suggested minimum size, 44 by 44 pixels, was considered a bit too large to mandate it across the board. However, this means that for Level AA compliant websites using the WCAG 2.1 framework, target size is not even considered.</p>

  <h3>Conclusion</h3>
  <p>This article derived problematic elements of WCAG 2.1 by referencing what was ammended in WCAG 2.2. However, there are other grievances that have yet to be addressed by the next draft. For example, WCAG editions to this point have been criticized regarding the lack of accessibility they provide to folks with <a href="https://www.levelaccess.com/blog/cognitive-disability-the-next-frontier-for-web-accessibility/">cognitive disabilities</a>, and a working group (called COGA) is currently trying to formulate guidelines and best practices. I will write a new article when I am more familiar with this everextending landscape.<p>

  <h2>Second Entry: [ALT], Accessibility, Aesthetics, and an Attempt at Synthesis</h2>

  <h3>Introduction: Captions as Poetry?</h3>

  <p>Let's watch a video together.</p>

  <p>Christine Sun Kim, a Deaf Korean/American woman wearing a velvet red crop top and light denim jeans, emerges behind a whimsical title screen that reads "[Closer Captions]." Against the white background, she adjusts her clothes, and takes a small breath before launching into the prepared mini-lecture that she delivers in her native language, American Sign Language. The entire video is one cut and Kim's tone is professional, but approachable. Music occasionally swells in the track, and Kim pauses to stare, so neutrally that it almost looks like she's unimpressed with the state of everything, directly at the camera. Under her, the captions read: </p>

  <blockquote>I think a lot about closed captions.
    Those little lines of text below me right now.
    As a non-hearing person, I rely on them.
    And here's a not-so-well-kept secret about closed captions:
    They suck.
    Captioning dialogue is one thing.
    But captioning sound is another.
    For example, if music starts to play.
    The captions might go something like:
    [music]
    One. Word.
    If I'm lucky, maybe I'll get:
    [violin music]
    Which is...better, but still not enough.
    It doesn't tell me anything about what the sound is made of.
    How it moves. Its personality.
    The more description, the better.
    So for instance:
    [mournful violin music]
    Or:
    [mournful violin music that sounds like crying alone in an empty bar]
    Or better yet:
    [mournful violin music that sounds like crying alone in an empty bar]
    [in 1920s Paris]
    [you're wearing a very tiny but fashionable hat]
    [that you tip to the bartender as you order a fourth martini]
    [music stops]
    That tells me something.
    I place a lot of trust in the people who write captions.
    But those people have a different relationship with sound
    and the world
    than I do.
    So I started to wonder...
    What would it look like if I wrote the captions myself?
    [the sound of anticipation intensifies]
    Let me show you.</blockquote>

<p>The screen fades to black, and a new set of captions move into the bottom of the screen. We see a daylight sky with clouds that look almost like ribbons, an open window with newly autumned trees swaying, white bedsheets against a white wall, we become lost in the bedsheets, a hand-held showerhead running, shower tiles that look like toffee, a hipster mug, silhouettes entering a train, a sweeping view of a giant train station, our eyes are downcast, sun against the floor tiles. </p>

<p>All of a sudden, ocean waves. Rippling as if they had a purpose, dancing against the sun.</p>

<p>Another shift. People standing in groups outside a cafe or bar, the sun is about to start setting. Zoom in to see their gestures. Sunset against an apartment building with blocky balconies. A different mattress. Nighttime, the distant crescent moon. An apartment door half-closed. We can't see the waves anymore. Everything is black.</p>

<p>The credits roll and the captions cease.</p>

    <blockquote>[day begins like the first line of a poem]
    [the sound of sun entering the bedroom]
    [the sound of eyelids opening]
    [electricity attempting to find its output]
    [phone wakes up too]
    [explosion of headlines]
    [sudden silence as finger breaks away from screen]
    [feet slapping onto bathroom tiles]
    [water in rhythmic drops]
    [drops get bigger]
    [louder]
    [the sound of shampoo scent floating among the fog]
    [towel crinkles]
    [the sound of skin waking up]
    [clicks of a stirring spoon]
    [second wind]
    [heavy traffic of footfall]
    [the scent of dry cotton mouth]
    [morning commute greets and whines]
    [the sound of strong exhaustion]
    [sweetness of orange sunlight]
    [glitter flirting with my eyeballs]
    [the sound of turning something over inside your head]
    [over and over]
    [in and out]
    [I sometimes see busy scenes in movies]
    [captioned with only one musical note]
    ðŸŽµ
    [I imagine this single note playing repeatedly]
    [incessantly]

    ðŸŽµ</blockquote>

  <p>I am drawn to this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfe479qL8hg">video by Kim</a> because it asks a question about the extent to which 'translation' between mediums can actually be faithfully done: audio and text, visual and linguistic. What information is lost in that translation?</p>

  <p>The alt attribute is one of the most widely known features of digital accessibility. I view it as a sort of translation: text content is used to substitute for an image. They are meant to be equivalents for each other. Of course, what 'equivelancy' means is highly contextual.</p>

  <h3></h3>
    
    <p>But the correct implementation of the alt attribute is a bit complex within the digital accessability space. There is a lot of discussion around what 'best practices' are. In this article, I interact with a series of articles that raise the issue of creating an equal aesthetic experience for screen-reader users.</p>

  <p>Within the Understanding docs for 1.1.1 Non-text Content, WCAG specifies that images that are 'pure decoration' should have their alt attribute set to null. Instead of providing a text description, such as 'red ball' to describe a red ball, leaving that field blank (hence nulling it) allows the screenreader to recognize it as a decorative image and to ignore it entirely. Pure decoration is given the following definition:</p>

  <blockquote cite="https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/non-text-content#dfn-pure-decoration">serving only an aesthetic purpose, providing no information, and having no functionality.</blockquote>

  <p></p>-->




  <!--I found that Criterion 1.1.1 Non-text Content was one of the hardest criteria to internalize when I was conducting my first scrappy website audit
  I remember being taught about the alt attribute during CodeAcademy, I remember being it taught during the one-hour crash course that my Internet Programming professor gave on HTML and CSS.-->
