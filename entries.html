  <h2>Second Entry: [ALT], Accessibility, Aesthetics, and an Attempt at Synthesis</h2>

  <h3>Introduction: Captions as Poetry?</h3>

  <p>Let's watch a video together.</p>

  <p>Christine Sun Kim, a Deaf Korean/American woman wearing a velvet red crop top and light denim jeans, emerges behind a whimsical title screen that reads "[Closer Captions]." Against the white background, she adjusts her clothes, and takes a small breath before launching into the prepared mini-lecture that she delivers in her native language, American Sign Language. The entire video is one cut and Kim's tone is professional, but approachable. Music occasionally swells in the track, and Kim pauses to stare, so neutrally that it almost looks like she's unimpressed with the state of everything, directly at the camera. Under her, the captions read: </p>

  <blockquote>I think a lot about closed captions.
    Those little lines of text below me right now.
    As a non-hearing person, I rely on them.
    And here's a not-so-well-kept secret about closed captions:
    They suck.
    Captioning dialogue is one thing.
    But captioning sound is another.
    For example, if music starts to play.
    The captions might go something like:
    [music]
    One. Word.
    If I'm lucky, maybe I'll get:
    [violin music]
    Which is...better, but still not enough.
    It doesn't tell me anything about what the sound is made of.
    How it moves. Its personality.
    The more description, the better.
    So for instance:
    [mournful violin music]
    Or:
    [mournful violin music that sounds like crying alone in an empty bar]
    Or better yet:
    [mournful violin music that sounds like crying alone in an empty bar]
    [in 1920s Paris]
    [you're wearing a very tiny but fashionable hat]
    [that you tip to the bartender as you order a fourth martini]
    [music stops]
    That tells me something.
    I place a lot of trust in the people who write captions.
    But those people have a different relationship with sound
    and the world
    than I do.
    So I started to wonder...
    What would it look like if I wrote the captions myself?
    [the sound of anticipation intensifies]
    Let me show you.</blockquote>

<p>The screen fades to black, and a new set of captions move into the bottom of the screen. We see a daylight sky with clouds that look almost like ribbons, an open window with newly autumned trees swaying, white bedsheets against a white wall, we become lost in the bedsheets, a hand-held showerhead running, shower tiles that look like toffee, a hipster mug, silhouettes entering a train, a sweeping view of a giant train station, our eyes are downcast, sun against the floor tiles. </p>

<p>All of a sudden, ocean waves. Rippling as if they had a purpose, dancing against the sun.</p>

<p>Another shift. People standing in groups outside a cafe or bar, the sun is about to start setting. Zoom in to see their gestures. Sunset against an apartment building with blocky balconies. A different mattress. Nighttime, the distant crescent moon. An apartment door half-closed. We can't see the waves anymore. Everything is black.</p>

<p>The credits roll and the captions cease.</p>

    <blockquote>[day begins like the first line of a poem]
    [the sound of sun entering the bedroom]
    [the sound of eyelids opening]
    [electricity attempting to find its output]
    [phone wakes up too]
    [explosion of headlines]
    [sudden silence as finger breaks away from screen]
    [feet slapping onto bathroom tiles]
    [water in rhythmic drops]
    [drops get bigger]
    [louder]
    [the sound of shampoo scent floating among the fog]
    [towel crinkles]
    [the sound of skin waking up]
    [clicks of a stirring spoon]
    [second wind]
    [heavy traffic of footfall]
    [the scent of dry cotton mouth]
    [morning commute greets and whines]
    [the sound of strong exhaustion]
    [sweetness of orange sunlight]
    [glitter flirting with my eyeballs]
    [the sound of turning something over inside your head]
    [over and over]
    [in and out]
    [I sometimes see busy scenes in movies]
    [captioned with only one musical note]
    🎵
    [I imagine this single note playing repeatedly]
    [incessantly]
    🎵
    [then a whole orchestra with nameless instruments holds note]

    🎵🎵🎵🎵🎵🎵

    🎵🎵🎵🎵🎵🎵🎵
    🎵🎵🎵🎵🎵
    🎵🎵🎵
    🎵🎵
    🎵
    [I think of silence as a note played quietly as possible]
    [key turns twice to lock]
    [the sound of socks peeling off feet]
    [whispered conversation]
    [words throwing punches]
    [the sound of hurt feelings scabbing over]
    [the sound of temperature slowly dropping]
    [the sound of stars having a conversation with each other]
    [air becomes stiff]
    [long and stretched sigh]
    [the sound of pillow holding head]
    [day ends like the last line of a poem]

  <p>I am drawn to this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfe479qL8hg">video by Kim</a> because it asks a question about the extent to which 'translation' between mediums can actually be faithfully done: audio and text, visual and linguistic. What information is lost in that translation?</p>

  <p>The alt attribute is one of the most widely known features of digital accessibility. I view it as a sort of translation: text content is used to substitute for an image. They are meant to be equivalents for each other. Of course, what 'equivelancy' means is highly contextual.</p>

  <h3></h3>
    
    <p>But the correct implementation of the alt attribute is a bit complex within the digital accessability space. There is a lot of discussion around what 'best practices' are. In this article, I interact with a series of articles that raise the issue of creating an equal aesthetic experience for screen-reader users.</p>

  <p>Within the Understanding docs for 1.1.1 Non-text Content, WCAG specifies that images that are 'pure decoration' should have their alt attribute set to null. Instead of providing a text description, such as 'red ball' to describe a red ball, leaving that field blank (hence nulling it) allows the screenreader to recognize it as a decorative image and to ignore it entirely. Pure decoration is given the following definition:</p>

  <blockquote cite="https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/non-text-content#dfn-pure-decoration">serving only an aesthetic purpose, providing no information, and having no functionality.</blockquote>

  <!--I found that Criterion 1.1.1 Non-text Content was one of the hardest criteria to internalize when I was conducting my first scrappy website audit
  I remember being taught about the alt attribute during CodeAcademy, I remember being it taught during the one-hour crash course that my Internet Programming professor gave on HTML and CSS.-->
