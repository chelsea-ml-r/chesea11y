    <p>I take notes and document my own engagement with the things that I learn every day. This is a place for me to keep myself accountable. Practically nothing here is proofread and the main audience of the things here is intended to be me.</p>
    <p>Currently, I am pursuing certification with the IAAP. To see all my CPACC notes in a more digestible version, go to the <a href="cpacc.html">CPACC section</a> of the website. It's ever-so-slightly more polished.</p>

      <h3>Accessible Information Guidelines: European Agency for Special Needs and Inclusive Education</h3>

      <p>The Body of Knowledge shows that we should not be so concerned with the guidelines themselves, than with the recommendations that the agency suggests for the implementation of these guidelines.</p>

      <h4>Memorizing</h4>

      <p>There are seven core recommendations for implementation, and I've drawn a small representation of the seven of them below.</p>


      <img src="images/accessible-info.png" alt="Diagram showing seven phases in implementation arranged in a clockwise circle with arrows pointing to each subsequent phase. Small doodles accompany each phase's name, all is elaborated below. ">

      <p>My memorization strategy is to associate the information with the small doodles that I've drawn here. The first stage, <strong>Statement</strong>, is associated with a silhouetted figure speaking. <strong>Strategy</strong> is associated with a document and a light bulb to signify a guiding light. <strong>Responsibility</strong> is associated with a silhouette with a crown ordering four small silhouettes to take off into four different directions. <strong>Incremental implementation</strong> has two doodles: first the toirtoise symbolizing the parable of the tortoise and the hare, second is a cardiogram that shows consistant heart beats. <strong>Production process</strong> is associated with two silhouetted figures at either end of a long table, hunched their laptops with steam rising from their heads. <strong>Training</strong> is associated with a silhouette lifting a massive weight above their head. Finally, <strong>Outsourcing</strong> sees a dark silhouetted figure hand over a bag of cash to a light silhouetted figure. </p>

      <h4>Seven Recommendations</h4>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Statement. "Include an accessibility statement in the organisation's long term strategy".</strong> For the authors of the implementation handbook, a public-facing accessibility statement will serve interally to drive and empower actors to get this work done. They acknowledge that the task of accessibility is one that is very easy to ignore and to write-off. Making a public statement a positive impression on clients, but it also creates client expectations for you to now follow through with.</li>

        <li><strong> Strategy. "Develop a strategy or plan for implementing accessible information."</strong> In order for a plan to even have a chance of working, it must meet the following criteria: It has buy-in the top, someone responsible of carrying it out, and enough people and other resources for them to do so. The plan should be contextualized within a grander long-term vision and should be developed with consultation from stakeholders. In drafting this strategy, citing the UCRPD's article 9 alongside other standards (regional and international), building in quality assurance measures, and being very explicit about what training is required will all help to create a more robust plan. Consider implementing a pilot program; the agency has seen the effectiveness of pilot programs demonstrated repeatedly.</li> 
        <li><strong> Responsibility. "Make someone responsible for implementing the information accessibility plan and provide them with the required resources."</strong> This person or team must be empowered formally and equipped with the resources to accomplish the goal. They need not be in a leadership position, but their authority on the matter of accessibility ought to be established as they will serve as the focal point for the whole endeavor.</li>
        <li><strong> Implement Incrementally. "Plan an incremental implementation â€“ be ambitious and modest at the same time."</strong> Have an ambitious long term vision, but don't jump into the deep end right away. Starting with simple tasks such as text, images, and audio are a way to build momentum. Identify the difficulty of various accessibility tasks and always start with the easy ones. This stage can also be accomplished through a pilot project. Note that some tasks might be too complex for existing staff to complete, and you may have to seek professional help. Ensure regular reviews on progress are completed and small wins serve to move the project forward.</li>
        <li><strong> Production Process. "Embed accessibility into your information production and dissemination processes."</strong> Make accessibility guidelines present at the point of production. Analyzing the workflow, identify where electronic templates and guidelines can be incorporated. This might not be the first thing you do (keep in mind incremental change), and it might start with a small group of stakeholders in a working group. Additionally, incorporate a mechanism that can provide a 'final accessibility check' prior to production. With all the training and prompting in the world, there will be times where it slips through the cracks.</li>
        <li><strong> Training. "Provide information, education and training on accessibility for all staff."</strong> This is a daunting task. Consider segmenting the training; alongside basic training that everyone receives, other roles get targetted training based on accessibility-relevant responsibilities. All staff, new and old, need to stay-up-to-date. Another consideration is to ensure third party workers are also equipped with accessibility competencies.</li>
        <li><strong> Outsourcing. "When outsourcing information production, make sure accessibility requirements are addressed and undergo a quality check."</strong> Develop a procurement policy that prioritizes accessibility, and a way to verify that accessible projects are actually delivered.</li>

      </ol>

      <h4>Organizational Implementation</h4>

      <p>The seven recommendations are slightly asynchronous and cannot be neatly organized in a timeline. In which case, the Agency suggests a three-phase model: Policy, Plan, Practice. This model might be especially pratical to organizations who want a tiered timeline.</p>

      <p>I'm going to break the category 'Practice' into two; one for training, and the other for production process. This is not how it is represented in the Body of Knowledge, but that's how it's reflected in the original source material. We're gonna go with more acronyms.</p>

      <h5>Policy</h5>
      <p><strong>LPP: Long-term, Public statement, Procurement</strong></p>
      <p>Like the Liberian People's Party!</p>
      <ul>
        <li>"Develop a long-term strategy that recognizes all aspects of disability."
        </li>
        <li>"Publish a public accessibility statement that includes a commitment to make your services and information accessible."
        </li>
        <li>"Develop a procurement policy that covers accessibility compliance for products and services, including those for information production and dissemination."
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h5>Plan</h5>
      <p><strong>DARPAR: Detailed, Ambitious, Realistic, and Person with Authority and Resources</strong></p>
      <p>A funny sitcom catch-phrase.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>"Develop an information accessibility plan that is detailed and ambitious, but realistic and covers small steps.</li>
        <li>"Ensure the person or team responsible for the plan has authority and resources"</li>
      </ul>
      <h5>Practice(1)</h5>
      <p><strong>PGSM: Pilot, General training, Specialized training, Materials</strong></p>
      <p>Like BDSM, but with a different plosive.</p>

      <ul>
        <li>"Conduct a pilot of the Guidelines."</li>
        <li>"Provide awareness training for all staff and how accessibility applies to information."</li>
        <li>"Provide training for content specialists on tools to make information accessible."</li>
        <li>"Produce style guides and templates."</li>
      </ul>
      <h5>Practice(2)</h5>
      <p><strong>UUTT: Update, Use the material, Third-party compliance, Test before release.</strong></p>
      <p>Maybe a sound made when your toe is stubbed?</p>

      <ul>
        <li>"Update work processes to embed information accessibility."</li>
        <li>"Create information using the style guides and templates."</li>
        <li>"Give external providers the Guidelines and requirements for compliance."</li>
        <li>"Conduct accessibility testing before releasing any services or publishing any."</li>
      </ul>

      <p>I've got to the point where I can cough it up pretty reliably. Let's move onto the actual content!</p>


      <h4>The Initiation Phase</h4>

      <p>The WAI separates the planning phase from the initiation phase, recognizing the awareness and broader buy-in/support is the number 1 reason for accessibility efforts to fail. Broadly, you should be generating two things in your initiating phase: Hype and Basic Education. If you're an organization newly pursuing an accessibility stage, this means a lot of outreach.</p>

      <p>Within the basic education portion of the initiation phase, come to have at least a basic idea of what accessibility entails and what your objective might be. Ideally, it should be a SMART objective with a clear timeline. At this stage, use your preliminary learning efforts to develop a business case tailoured to the scope of your work. If you are an individual, find your own motivation and 'case for accessibility' that can help sustain focus throughout the next three stages.</p>

      <p>Now, to generate hype. Invite everyone to learn the basics and to feel connected to the business case. Across your organization, tailour the argument to what workers themselves can get from the endeavor (new skills, etc), and create opportunities to share knowledge and generate excitement. Some of these will be formal, but informal chats will be helpful too. Literally everyone at some level has some opportunity to contribute to accessibility, but some people will have a harder time seeing this.</p>
      
      <p>With your motivation established, the ball is rolling. It's time to start actually planning an implementation.</p>

      <h4>The Planning Phase</h4>

      <p>The planning phase centers around establishing the who, the what, the why, and the how.</p>

      <p>What exactly are the activities the project pursues? Review the current state of the websites the project is concerned with, and craft an accessibility policy was a defined scope and timeframe, and accounting for contingencies.</p>

      <p>How will you execute this project? Determine the budget and the resources you are able to dedicate to this endeavor, considering also what kind of evaluations, training and tools may have to be secured. Decide on what sort of monitoring framework you will use to track progress once the implementation stage is formally underway; ensure some kind of standard reporting structure can regularly assess where progress is being made. Additionally, take a bird's eye few of this new policy within the greater context of your organization. What activities and norms will re-enforce the project? Where might there be some conflict? How much training will you and your staff need?</p>

      <p>This takes us to the 'who' of it all. Who is doing what? Identify the accessibility responsibilities of each role within the organization and assign responsibilities as needed. Identify those key actors that will require additional training.</p>

      <p>In ensuring these logistical aspects are worked out, don't lose sight of building your momentum. Engage your stakeholders and continue the hype train, bring them on board if you haven't done so already. This includes internal and external stakeholders: supplies, advocates, the broader public. Engaging the public now can increase internal morale and sense of responsibility. Ensure there are clear lines of communication to management, and ensure they too have bought in.</p>

      <h4>The Implementation Phase</h4>

      <p>Finally, we can concentrate all of our engineered hype and prep into action. Start by building capacity through training targeted at different roles. Maintan momentum by directing energy towards low-hanging fruit at first before tackling increasingly difficult issues. Start evaluating your approach early on, and use those evaluation to revisit your accessibility policy to ensure that your objectives are still properly reflected in your plan.</p>
      <p>Ensure everyone knows what they are expected to do and are equipped for success.</p>
      <p>Include testing with Disabled users if feasible. Record progress and share early wins. Ensure the knowledge gained in training embeds itself into the fabric of the organization by facilitating regular knowledge sharing and progress reports. Accessibility is an everyone project, so making progress visible is very important.</p>

      <p>When the bulk of the main project is complete, you can transition into the final phase.</p>

      <h4>The Sustain Phase</h4>

      <p>Continue to monitor the situation to ensure new habits stick. Engage stakeholders and solicit user feedback: do people internally and externally still feel on board? Do internal stakeholders feel any impact from the accessibility endeavor leaking into other aspects of daily activities?</p>

      <p>Additionally, you will need to adapt to new changes in technology and regulations to ensure your efforts don't stagnate in a frequently changing world. It is best to anticipate this and have a process already in place for what to do when changes occur, and when new user feedback is received. </p>

      <h3>Source: <a href="https://social.desa.un.org/issues/disability/crpd/convention-on-the-rights-of-persons-with-disabilities-crpd">Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities</a></h3>
      <p>Most of the information here is buried further into the website, so let's review a couple of pages individually.</p>

      <h4>1. <a href="https://social.desa.un.org/issues/disability/cosp/frequently-asked-questions-regarding-the-convention-on-the-rights-of-persons">CRPD Frequently Asked Questions</a></h4>

      <dl>
        <dt>Do Disabled people have special human rights?</dt>
        <dd>Every human has the same human rights. The CRPD endeavors to ensure Disabled people actually get the same rights as everyone else.</dd>
        <dt>What is the Optional Protocol?</dt>
        <dd>Allows individuals who feel a breach of their rights has happened a mechanism to petition. Also, gives the Committee authority to do inquiries for large systemic violations.</dd>
        <dt>What other international standards are there?</dt>
        <dd>The Declaration, of course. But there's also the World Programme of Action Concerning Disabled Persons, the Principles for the Protection of Persons with Mental Illness and the Improvement of Health Care, and Standard Rules on the Equalization of Opportunities for Persons with Disabilities. All of these are older and none are legally binding. Also the one about mental health has some Problematic Elements. </dd>
        <dt>Okay but what about international standards that are actually legally binding?</dt>
        <dd>There are a bunch of conventions, but many don't name disability status explicitly. Uniquely, the Convention on the Rights of the Child does name it. Regardless, these other conventions apply to all humans, and if you are operating under the assumption that Disabled people are human, well they're entitled to all the rights and protections of those conventions too.</dd>
        <dt>What sets apart the CRPD from these other conventions?</dt>
        <dd>It goes way more into depth and the specifics than previous conventions have gone into. It's the first convention adopted after 2000, and it integrates a social development perspective, recognizing the importance of international cooperation in supporting national implementation efforts.</dd>
        <dt>What are the principles of the convention?</dt>
        <dd>Mnemonic: DACAGON. Diversity, Accessibility, Children's rights, Autonomy, Gender equality, Opportunity equality, Non-discrimination</dd>
        <dt>How does the CRPD define disability and qualify Disabled people?</dt>
        <dd>The CRPD breaks slightly from the definition we saw in the DRPD, as it takes primarily from the biopsychosocial model of disability. Disability, in the view of the CRPD, results from the interaction between impairements and barriers. Article 1 suggests these impairments are 'long-term,' but they've pulled some legal wording wizardry to ensure that isn't some kind of qualifier. </dd>

      </dl>
      <h4>2. <a href="https://social.desa.un.org/issues/disability/cosp/the-convention-in-brief">The Convention in Brief</a></h4>

      <p>Here it summarizes all relevant parts of the convention. Here's some things that stick out to me as pertaining to accessibility, inclusion, and to disability culture in general.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Article 9 tackles the 'foundational issue of accessibility.'</li>
        <li>Article 19 tackles the idea of community living: an ideal long fought for within the community.</li>
        <li>Article 20 deals with access to mobility aids and technology.</li>
        <li>Article 28 deals with financial assistance with regards to disability expenses.</li>
        <li>Article 21 promotes access to information, and the use of Braille, sign language, and accessible forms of communication.</li>
        <li>Article 22 talks about appropriate forms of education.</li>
        <li>Article 25 discusses the need to not be discriminated against in the provision of health insurance.</li>
      </ul>

      <h4>3. <a href="https://www.un.org/development/desa/disabilities/convention-on-the-rights-of-persons-with-disabilities/the-10th-anniversary-of-the-adoption-of-convention-on-the-rights-of-persons-with-disabilities-crpd-crpd-10.html">10th Anniversary of the Convention</a></h4>
      <p>There's less here than I anticipated. They report 'remarkable progress' in the ten years since the implementation of the Convention, note that the UNCRPD has been the convention with the fastest rate of adoption, and that numerous sustainable development frameworks have used the CRPD and within their methods and guiding values.</p>
      <p>These frameworks include the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction, the World Humanitarian Summit and the New Urban Agenda.</p>

      <p>The body of knowledge, in leaving many of these terms undefined, leaves the reader to just imagine what is allowed and disallowed in the treaty. This treaty <strong>provides a legal exception to copyright law</strong>and <strong>allows for the creation, import and export</strong> of accessible transcriptions.</p>
      <p>I just used the word 'transcription' there, because it is more precise than the word 'edition.' With an accessible edition, I imagine plain language formats alongside ASL translations, alongside other things. But that isn't what this covers.</p>
      <blockquote>
        Currently only some 1-7per cent of the worldâ€™s published books ever make it into accessible formats.
      </blockquote>
      <p>The treaty actually prohibits any transformation of the content of the work. Merely switch around the format; Braille, electronic, audio and large print.</p>
      <p>Also, not everyone can get their hands on these accessible formats. Only Beneficiaries, defined as anyone who has trouble with regular printed formats, should receive these editions. The beneficiary population is mostly blind and low-vision folks, but the folks at the World Blind Union also mention dyslexia as a potential qualifying circumstance. According to them, people who physically can't turn normal pages for whatever reason also may qualify.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Article 2(a): Works covered include texts (books, periodicals), sheet music, but not films.</li>
        <li>Article 2(b): Accessible format copies can come in many form.</li>
        <li>Article 2(c): Groups making the accessible format copies must either be government agencies, non-profits, or for-profits working on a non profit basis, and the work must be directed towards beneficiaries. </li>
        <li>Article 3: Who is a beneficiary? Print-disabled folks.</li>
        <li>Article 4: Ratifying states must make a domestic copyright exception.</li>
        <li>Articles 5-6: Permits cross-border exchange of materials.</li> 
        <li>Article 7: If required for accessibility, DRM can be bypassed.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Source: <a href="https://www.wipo.int/treaties/en/ip/marrakesh/summary_marrakesh.html">WIPO, Summary of the Marrakesh Treaty</a></h3>

      <p>WIPO offers a legality-centered summary of the Marrakesh treaty. The treaty's full name is "Marrakesh Treaty to Facilitate Access to Published Works for Persons Who Are Blind, Visually Impaired, or Otherwise Print Disabled (MVT) (2013)." Here are tidbits from this document that helped clarify my understanding of this matter:</p>

      <p>First of all, the treaty refers to the beneficiary persons as VIPs. This is why we saw this wording within the Body of Knowledge summary. WIPO's summary does not mention dyselxia as a potential condition that might be cause for print disability, but the wording is ambiguous enough here that dyslexia may still have a chance of qualifying. (Cross referencing this <a href="http://cfla-fcab.ca/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Getting_Started_FAQ_Marrakesh_Treaty_a_practical_guide_for_librarians_Canada_2019.pdf">Librarian's guide to the Marrakesh treaty,</a> developmental and learning abilities like dyslexia and autism, can in fact count as 'print disabilities.'
      </p>
      <p>Secondly, authorized entites have various obligations to establish and follow practices for ensuring the system doesn't get mis-used. These are up to individual authorized entities, not up to states.</p>
      <p>Thirdly, VIPS can make duplicates of accessible formats that were produces lawfully under the treaty. These are personal use copies, and they aren't allowed to redistribute them.</p>
      <p>Fourth, the 'commercial exception' that the World Blind Union touches on is further expounded. The Marrakesh treaty allows signatories, within their implementation, to basically say, 'If an accessible format is available comercially, don't freaking do it, the copyright doesn't apply.' I'm sure this kind of case applies very much to the ePub format, which is increasing in popularity. BUT, if signatories add this clause in the policy, they have to basically contact the WIPO Director General, and then WIPO can get all up in that signatory nation's businesss. </p>
      <p>Fifth, there is a constraint on exports-- you can only export an accessible copy made under the terms of the Marrakesh treaty to people within a country who has also signed the Treaty. This makes a good deal of logical sense. If country A has signed the treaty, and person A sneaks a copy to person B of country B, who has not signed the treaty, it would violate the laws and sovereignty of country B to declare that the Treaty of Marrakesh allowed you to do this. Similarly, if person B made their own accessible copy illegally and sent it to person A, that copy is still piracy.</p>
      <p>Sixthly, members of WIPO or the European union are allowed to join the Marrakesh Treaty. You do NOt need to be a member of the United Nations, or any other international body besides the WIPO, to then join.</p>

      <p>Finally, the Treaty needed 20 ratifying or accending members before it entered in the force. So despite being adopted in 2013, it has only actually been in force since 2016.</p>

      <h2 id="note-65">Goal Setting #3 </h2>
      <p>Noted Friday, December 6, 2024</p>
  
      <p>Confetti! It's another eighteen days and I still haven't given up! Once again, I was not very close to meeting my targets for this term, but I did get a LOT done, I met some important parameters, and have some valuable knowledge I can use to set new goals. 
      </p>
      <h3>Nov 18 - Dec 6 Accomplishments</h3>
      <h4>Time logged</h4>
      <p>November remains the highest amount of logged activity for me (over 80 hours) and the natural quota of 3 hours a day, 20+ hours a week, emerged as goal posts that I now strive to meet. I don't make 3 hours a day every day, but I do make it some days, and it feels good. I have developed a habit of making Saturdays be my most productive day. I go out and occupy some poor cafe or restaurant's table and crank out a 6 hour work session.</p>
      <p>A full-time job in Canada is 40 hours of week, 8 hours a day. My day job takes up 10 hours a week/2 hours per weekday, and if I add in the 20 hours that I spend on accessibility, this works out to about 30 hours a week. And doing that does feel like an accomplishment. It's only 3/4 of full-time work, but maybe that's my neurodivergent sweet spot, and perhaps there are ways I can further tweak and ammend my strategy to get better results.</p>

      <h4>Wordcount and Blogging</h4>

      <p>Between Goal-Setting Sessions 1 and 2, I wrote about 7200 words on my learning blog. In this last period, I wrote 12 600, which is quite some growth! I also completed 10 CPACC study sessions/entries along with two sessions with WAS-oriented Deque material.</p>
      <p>I also put a bunch of CPACC notes into the new <a href="cpacc.html">CPACC section</a> of the blog. Looking back on all these entries really makes me feel motivated to clean up the grammar and spellcheck, but that can come slightly later as I'm doing a second sweep of the material.</p>
      <p>Finally, I bought a proper domain name using Porkbun and connected it to my Github page. I really like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cha_siu_bao">chasiubao</a> so this seems appropriate.</p>

      <h4>HTML and CSS</h4>
      <p>My main HTML/CSS project is coming along and it looks spiffy and cool! I am happy that I am getting more comfortable with CSS. It provides me a good outlet to blow off steam in and I find it relaxing. It helps me not lose my mind with all the CPACC prep. Two pages are complete and fully responsive, though I've yet to present it to the client for feedback.</p> 
      <p>Also, I think I finally may have got this blogging site to be okay on mobile? It took a fair amount of trial and error.</p>

      <h4>CPACC content covered</h4>
      <p>I set some ambitious goals for myself, and didn't quite meet them. However, I did cover the following material:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>1A. Models of Disability.</li>
        <li>2A. Accomodations vs UD</li>
        <li>2B. Benefits of Accessibility</li>
        <li>2C. Web Accessibility (memorized: 14 principles of WCAG)</li>
        <li>2D. Build Environment Accessibility</li>
        <li>2E. Principles of UD (memorized: 7 principles + all subpoints)</li>
        <li>2F. Principles of UDL (memorized 43 points of UDL)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>And I made decent headway into 3A. International Level Standards.</p>
      <P>In other words, I did almost all of Domain 2, I still have Usability to cover, but we're very, very close!</P>
      <p>In terms of what the CPACC questions consist of, that's about 40% covered. But is it 40% of the material? Hell Naw.</p>

      <h3>Nov 18 - Dec 6 Areas to Improve</h3>
      <h4>Exhaustion</h4>
      <p>A lot of the CPACC material is exhausting because it perpetuates a portrait of disability that removes systemic inequality from the picture and evangelizes a world where if you just make the environment, accessible, you've achieved accessibility. This is simply untrue.</p>
      <p>So my progress on the material has actually been at a turtle's pace, but I keep beating myself up about it. I need to acknowledge that the material is itself hard to engage with, plan my study sessions more deliberately, and find coping strategies.</p>
      <p>My audit project has similarly suffered from an ADHD case of "shove it in a box and don't touch it, if they move, they can't see you." I need to reopen it and reapproach it and still be kind to myself.</p>
      <p>Part of my exhaustion might derive from feeling like I can't really rest and that I should always be working.</p>
      <h4>Anxiety</h4>
      <p>I'm getting more and more anxious irrationally that this is all for nothing and that the time I'm investing now will never pay off and this industry isn't for me. None of this anxiety really has any super factual basis. The EAA will soon come into full force. More people will need to be hired. This knowledge is in demand.</p>
      <p>I suppose it's just another symptom of being inable to account for time, another sympom of being nearsighted in terms of planning for the future and always living in the present.</p>
      <p>I think scheduling out a more comprehensive plan and timeline for preparing for the CPACC will help alleviate some of this stress, as it gives me some foresight into what the immediate future will hold.</p>

      <h3>Goal-Setting</h3>
      <h4>Ammendments on Process</h4>
      <p>In the future I'm going to take weekends into account this time in my goal-setting. We'll aim for the goal deadline to be in 18 work days, not counting week-ends (which are Wednesdays and Saturdays).</p>
      <p>However, I am planning on taking a vacation from December 24 to January 5. If I set my next checkpoint day on the 23rd, we end up with 12 work days, or 16 days in total.</p>
      <p>I'm also going to break down Domain 3 into smaller parts than just A, B, C, etc, and I'm going to assign a timeline to each.</p> 

      <dl class="schedule">
        <dt>Saturday Dec 7</dt>
        <dd>International Standards (3A) Due</dd>
        <dt>Monday Dec 9</dt>

        <dt>Monday Dec 23</dt>
        <dd>Checkpoint Day + Goal Reflection</dd>

      </dl>

      <p>This seems spread out enough to where I can actively try to work ahead of the due dates. If I don't make the due dates, there's no shame. I need to understand that shame is not a productive emotion here. When this is over, it basically just leaves 1D, 3C, and 3E incomplete, as well as leaving 1B, 1C, and 3F partially complete.</p>
      <p>From here, I'm left with about one month until D-day, but I can also study through my holiday if I ever get the itch to do so.</p>
      <p>In an ideal world, I will be able to cover everything in my timeline and then some, but it is only 12 days. And I am just one small-framed Disabled nonbinary person.</p>
      <p>I will be kind to myself.</p>

      <p>Noted Thursday, December 5, 2024</p>
      <h3>More Reflection</h3>
      <p>I think I have to remember that I've only been studying for this thing for slightly over two weeks, and that of course this process is going to be long and exhausting and discouraging. I cannot believe that there have been people that dedicate less to two weeks to study for this. But also, I might just be over-preparing on certain sections and not managing my time correctly.</p>
      <p>International Standards have been particularly exhausting because I have no idea what I need to memorize. They link to the website of the UNCRPD. Am I supposed to memorize... all the material on this website? That seems like a Bit Much. I started last entry by saying that this is likely the easiest section within Domain 3 and I kinda played it off. But no, there is substantial content here.</p>
      <p>I suppose in the end complaining about it won't do anything. We can lean on the recommended study tasks: </p>
      <blockquote>
        Name the most prominent international declarations and conventions that protect human
rights and the rights of people with disabilities.
      </blockquote>
      <p>and</p>
      <blockquote>Explain the main purpose and protections of the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.</blockquote>
      <p>Better overprepared than underprepared. Freaking suck it up buttercup. </p>

      <h3>Source: Body of Knowledge (continued)</h3>
      <h4>The Marrakesh Treaty</h4>
      <p>The World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) administeries a body of international copyright treaties. For a long time, copyright limitations have prevented accessible formats of texts from being produced easily. The Marrakesh Treaty, adopted on June 27, 2013, provides a copyright exception in service of making the creation of such accessible formats more easy.</p>

      <h3>Source: <a href="https://www.un.org/en/about-us/universal-declaration-of-human-rights">Universal Declaration of Human Rights</a></h3>
      <h4>The Document</h4>
      <p>More tiny little details about the document itself:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>When? 10 December 1948</li>
        <li>Where? Paris.</li>
        <li>Translated into 500+ languages.</li>
        <li>Paved the way for 70+ human rights treaties.</li>
        <li>What? General Assembly Resolution 217 A</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Now it does feel silly to memorize all 30 points of this article. So I'm going to narrow it down to just the super relevant things.</p>

      <h4>UDHR Articles 1-2</h4>
      <p>I present an abbreviated form of these articles here:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Article 1: All humans are born free and equal in dignity and rights.
        </li>
        <li>
          Article 2: Rights and freedoms apply to all, without discrimination.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>Article 2 explicitly lists a whole bunch of categories that cam't be used as basis for discimination. Disability status is not listed as part of these, though it is implied that the UDHR is not restricted to the categories that it does name.</p>
      <p>The first two articles are the basis for which all the other articles follow; the assertion of inalienable human rights as a new rule of law in the natural order is nothing to scoff at.</p>

      <h4>UDHR Articles 3-30</h4>
      <p>Simultaneously, we should look to see what kind of themes and priorities are reflected across the other 27 articles.</p>

      <p>One prevalent theme is <Strong>'everybody has the right to not get mistreated'</Strong> worded in many different ways: freedom from torture, get a fair trial, be able to get out of bad situations.</p>

      <p>Another theme evolves around <strong>'basic everyday needs and activity'</strong> which include living conditions, work, rest, education, social living, family, and free expression.</p>

      <p>Another theme concerns the <strong>governance</strong> of the nation and international order. On the national level, this addresses things like peaceful assembly, labour unions, participating in government, equal laws. On the global level, it calls for international collaboration to ensure everyone gets accesses to these rights. </p>

      <h4>Overview</h4>
      <p>The Office facilitates engagement with this issue at the intergovernmental level and also recruits dialoguing partners from representative organisations of Disabled people. </p><p>The Office promotes awareness, and also ensures Disabled people are seen and considered in greater projects across the whole United Nations apparatus, including with the Sustainable Development Goals. They name the UN Disability Inclusion Strategy as a particular example of this.</p>
      <h4><a href="https://www.ohchr.org/en/disabilities/about-human-rights-persons-disabilities">About the Human Rights of Disabled People</a></h4>
      <p>In this section, we see main points from the Body of Knowledge reflected back at us. The CRPD, 2006 for adoption, 2008 when it came into force, took up the social model and took to articulate the UDHR promise in explicit and pragmatic terms within the disability context.</p>
      <p>But we also see some new and exciting points. The Office acknowledges that disability status interacts with other facets of identity and cirumstances in further disabling ways, especially in developing countries. In addition to this, they describe the CRPD as being more capable of dealing with these more complex cases of discrimination; Disabled women and children are explicitly addressed within the wording of the CRPD. We end with this very poignant quote,</p>

      <blockquote>
        [R]eaching the furthest behind first is the key to leaving no one behind.
      </blockquote>

      <p>This is a very common sentiment within the larger conversation of Disability Studies, especially Disability Justice activism led by queer and trans Disabled BIPOC.</p>
      <p>This small article also might be the first time that we see some material realities of Disabled people acknowledged. Disabled people commonly are confined to institutions, are barred from voting, are unable to have their own property, are forcefully segregated from the mainstream at various levels of society (including within the justice system, don't get me started!) among other things.</p>
      <p>I feel like the whole curriculum would have been better if we started the talk about disability with this, with the history. Not to paint a deficit ideology portrait of disability in general, but true accessibility will never be met as long as basic needs are not met and material conditions don't change. As Certified Accessibility Professionals, shouldn't this be something that we should know?</p>

      <h3>Source: <a href="https://www.ohchr.org/en/instruments-mechanisms/instruments/declaration-rights-disabled-persons">Declaration on the Rights of Disabled Persons</a></h3>

      <p>This is the full text of the Declaration. It's shorter than I had anticipated, and way more interesting than I had anticipated. Here are points I note in reading it.</p>

      <p>They cite a bunch of predecessing declarations, including the Declaration on the Rights of Mentally R******d Persons which feels like it comes out of nowhere. What IS that? Passed in 1971, it echoes a lot of the attitudes towards people with intellectual and/or developmental disabilities and the type of care that should be organized for them up to nearly the present day. It falls to the wayside, just as the DRDP falls to the wayside, because the CRPD is just so much stronger as an instrument of policy making.</p>

      <p>Moving on, we see the little exception that developing countries "can devote only limited efforts" and can therefore be excused from a lot of these things.</p>
      <p>With the caveats and background done, we jump into the declaration itself, which starts off with a fascinating definition of disability. I am drawn to this one. It's a function-based definition where the bar to clear is 'ensuring for oneself the necessities of a normal individual (or social) life' but it's supported by some classic medical-model based, 'as a result of dificiency in physical or mental capabilities.'</p>
      <p>The document doesn't contain the word 'accessibility.' It's slightly present within the phrase 'measures designed to enable them to become as self-reliant as possible,' but it never really addresses the idea of inaccessibility, or the environment being the problem somehow. Instead, assitive technology and interventions on the individual or 'treatment' is the thing that is promised to all Disabled people, which is slightly insidious. It's all under the guise that the rehabilitation is always the right move and the right goal. This simply does not give autonomy to the Disabled person, and it leaves the Disabled people who never get better, either because they can't get better or don't want to get better, out in the dust.</p>
      <p>I think in reading this, it really drives home the fact that there has been significant progress in society's attitude. It's still bad, but it used to be much, much worse. And many people who were raised in eras where the social model was not at all present might still continue to have really outdated beliefs.</p>

      <h2 id="note-63">CPACC Study Day 14/18: International Standards</h2>
      <p>Noted Tuesday, December 3, 2024</p>

      <p>Alas, we've arrived into Domain 3 territory. I am a bit nervous, not going to lie. There is a lot of memorization involved in these sections. But today I'm going to do probably the easiest section within Domain 3. An amuze-bouche, I suppose that's what this is. No use procrastinating getting started on it. There's so much here. *screaming*</p>

      <h3>Source: Body of Knowledge</h3>

      <h4>Introduction to International Standards</h4>

      <p>First, we learn about three approaches to addressing the rights of Disabled people through legislation. </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Legislation grants the rights.</li>
        <li>Legislation prohibits discrimination against disability.</li>
        <li>Legislation addresses the rights directly.</li>        
      </ul>

      <p>We take a walk through history, through three documents that mirror these three approaches.</p>

      <p>It's 1948 and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights is passed. Disabled people are not one of the groups protected in this document.</p>

      <p>The UDHR proclaims civil, cultural, economic, political and social rights to be for all peoples and provides the basis for other international standards, notably the 2006 Convention.</p>

      <p>It's 1975 and the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Disabled Persons is passed. As a declaration (as opposed to a Convention), it can only provide recommendations.</p>

      <p>While the Declaration asserts the need for Disabled people to be protected against discriminatory treatment and promotes their integration into all facets of society, it accepts that not all countries can presently afford to devote resources beyond 'limited efforts' to achieve this vision.</p>

      <p>It's 2006 and the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities finally provides a legally beinding convention.</p>

      <h4>Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (UNCRPD)</h4>
      <p>This is the most important document to know about, because in signing onto the CRPD, states parties must actually implement it.</p>
      <p>The language is a bit dense here, so I'll paraphrase from the Body of Knowledge in the style of question-and-answer.</p>

      <dl>
        <dt>
          Through what model does the UNCRPD approach people with disabilities?
        </dt>
        <dd>The UNCRPD follows the movement to shift towards the social model of disability and away from the medical and charity models of disability, as has historically been the case in policy-making.</dd>
        <dt>Broadly speaking, what does the UNCRPD do?</dt>
        <dd>Reaffirming that Disabled people are a category of people with protected rights and freedoms, it makes explicit that extra steps need to be taken in order for Disabled people to enjoy these rights and freedoms. In discussing these extra steps, the UNCRPD talks about how Disabled people need accomodations and how Disabled people may have their rights violated. Fundamentally, the UNCRPD is focused on implementation.</dd>
        <dt>What support does the UNCRPD have?</dt>
        <dd>The UNCRP has very broad support. Over 180 countries/regional unions have ratified it, meaning they have committed to implementing internal policies to achieve the UNCRP's mandate. The UNCRP has been signed by over 160 countries/regional unions (there is overlap between these two groups). The EU is very supportive of the UNCRPD; it signed and ratified as itself, and then all EU member states ratified it individually.</dd>
        <dt>What are ratified states obligated to do?</dt>
        <dd>They are obligated to establish a framework to Promote, Protect, and Monitor the implementation of the CRPD.</dd>
        <dt>What monitors the ratified states parties?</dt>
        <dd>The Committee on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities conducts regular reviews. Non-government bodies can submit to compilation called a 'List of Issues.' When state parties report back, they have to respond to the List of Issues. (The BoK is kind vague about the process here, and I'm having trouble finding resources concerning this).</dd>
        <dt>What does the UNCRPD say about accessibility?</dt>
        <dd>A lot. Accessibility the fifth principle listed in Article 3: General Principles, and the entirety of Article 9 is dedicated to hashing out the nitty-gritty. </dd>
      </dl>

      <p>The authors of the BoK then proceed to lay out the full text Article 9. The spirit of Article 9 basically is as follows: State parties should endeavor to so that all environments that are accessible to the public, whether they are publically or privately funded, whether they are urban or rural, whether they are physical or digital, are also accessible to people with disabilities. They should provide minimum standards and training to get to this point. Additionally, Disabled people should have access to assistive technology and live support (guides, interpreters) that can facilitate access to information, including digital information. Also, in the physical world, Braille signage and plain language signage should be available always.</p>

      <h2 id="note-62">CPACC Study Day 13/18: UD for Built Environments</h2>
      <p>Noted Monday, December 2, 2024</p>
      
      <p>I'm coming up on my <a href="#note-51">December 6 deadline</a> and I still have 3.5 units to go: 2D Built Environment, 2G Usability, 3A International, and 3F Organizational. To meet my goal, I pretty much have to be progressing at a rate of one topic per day...  I don't think I'm going to make it. I am not going to be able to meet the deadlines for my website building and informal audit, but I am not too perturbed. This information gives me an idea of what I can accomplish in about 18 days.</p>
      <p>I'm still going to celebrate another 18 days of perserverence.</p>

      <p>Yesterday, I went ahead and created the entire new 'CPACC' section of my website, where I extract information from this area of the website, and make the content more legible. I also purchased a domain name and deployed it.</p>

      <p>As always, a quick warmup before we drive into the actual content.</p>

      <h3>HTMLHell Advent Calendar</h3>
      <h4><a href="https://www.htmhell.dev/adventcalendar/2024/1/">Rian Rietveld on Home/Logo alt text</a></h4>

      <p>I don't like this article? I disagree that it should be labelled as anything other than 'Leidschendam-Voorburg home' because the image here is functional and we want to be as conservative as possible when it comes to frequently used functional images.</p>

      <p>I disagree that the word 'logo' gives any more information than is already there on the page. It is a common idiom to link to a logo. You wouldn't link to just an image of text; that's not conformant to WCAG.</p>

      <p>Simultaneously, the discussion about verbosity (to be or not to be verbose) is mostly stylistic here. So while I disagree with the practice suggested here, I can't really say that my approach would be emperically better. Because screenreader users also have differing preferences.</p>

      <p>There was also a missed opportunity here to say <em>why you shouldn't use aria-label</em> besides just the First Rule: which is the fact that aria-label doesn't translate.</p>
      <h4><a href="https://www.htmhell.dev/adventcalendar/2024/2/">Killian Valhof on Autofocus</a></h4>
      <p>This feels sound. My one nitpick is that Valhof uses 'assistive technology' as a synonym for 'screenreader.'</p>
      <p>They argue that while you generally shouldn't use tabindex and autofocus, the one usecase for autofocus would be "on single-purpose pages containing forms."</p>

      <h3><a href="https://youtu.be/_6Tu3TOMzQE">Adrian Roselli at A11y Camp</a></h3>
      <p>Been waiting for this one for a while! Saw the slides for this and was so dang curious about them. It's about the career lifecycle of accessibility professionals and the inevitability of burnout.</p>
      <p>I feel really called out by 'under-utilized English degree.'</p>


      <h3>Accessibility and the Built Environment</h3>

      <h4>Source: <a href="https://rm.coe.int/CoERMPublicCommonSearchServices/DisplayDCTMContent?documentId=09000016805a2a24">Council of Europe, Accessibility: Principles and Guidelines (PDF)</a></h4>

      <p>This a pretty dense document from 2004 that sounds like it was translated, likely from the French. The source establishes that with a raising population of Disabled people, it is for the better of society that accessibility not hinder Disabled people from enjoying their human rights. Six focus areas are named as composing a larger accessibility plan for Europe:</p>

      <dl>
        <dt>1. Integrated Solutions</dt>
        <dd>This is an argument for a universalizing approach, as opposed to an accomodations approach. We might even want to incoporate this into our standards.</dd>
        <dt>2. Building for Everyone</dt>
        <dd>This argues that everyone, not just Disabled users, benefit from universally designed spaces. Age, familiy situation, and occupation are named as three factors that might otherwise 'handicap' a non-Disabled person.</dd>
        <dt>3. Accessibility Chart</dt>
        <dd>An 'accessibility chart' would be a full inventory kept by urban planners  of all public buildings as well as their accessibility classifications. This information should be made available to the public and provides a transparent assessment of the status of accessibility on the municiple level.</dd>
        <dt>4. Monitoring</dt>
        <dd>This argues that broad surveys on the effectiveness of accessibility planning be established and conducted regularly.</dd>
        <dt>5. Architectual education</dt>
        <dd>Develop curriculum for 'integrated solutions' alongside people with disabilities and propogate it at the undergraduate level, as well as offering more opportunties for continued education around these topics. </dd>
        <dt>6. International cooperation</dt>
        <dd>All member states should participate in exchanging information, practices and findings as we embark on this journey together.</dd>
      </dl>

      <p>The second section of walks you through various architectural considerations on a 'imaginary journey.' It pelts you with considerations that must be made for various aspects of architectural design. At nearly every turn, we can make parallels towards the 7 Universal Design Principles, so I'm going to attempt to list out the considerations that they ask us to make with respect to these principles.</p>

      <h5>Principle #7: Size and Space</h5>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Outside
          <ul>
            <li>Pedestrian corridors have enough space to accomodate different sizes and assistive technology: they are not too narrow, they do not have unexpected obstacles, they do not have things that tall people can bump into.</li>
            <li>Parking spaces have enough space and aren't too narrow for wheelchair users.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          Public Transport
          <ul>
            <li>Features can accomodate people of a range of sizes. For example, straps for standing passagers are not too high that shorter people cannot reach them, and seating space is not so small that larger passengers cannot use them.</li>
            <li>Adequate space is provided for the use of assistive devices on approach: wheelchair users can enter the vehicle.</li>
            <li>Adequate space is provided for the use of assistive devices within the vehicle: aisles are not too crowded.</li>
            <li>People of various sizes can enter the vehical: stairs are not too steep that a person of shorter stature cannot reach them.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          Buildings
          <ul>
            <li>Adequate space is provided for use of assistive devices on approach: there are no obstructions in the entrance, and the approach is not too narrow, as the door is not too low.</li>
            <li>Users who need more space to navigate within the building can do so: corridors are not too narrow, and users of assistive technology can access bathrooms, toilets, balconies, and storage rooms.</li>
            <li>Users of various sizes can access interior features, such as cabinets, letter boxesentrances, specially adapted toilets for wheelchair users, induction loops for the
              â€˜hard of hearingâ€™ and housing for elderly people. This â€˜item ised approachâ€™ still
              views people with disabilities as exceptions to the rule., and coat racks. These things aren't too high to be out of reach.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h5>Principle #4: Perceptible Information and Principle #3 Simple and Intuitive</h5>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Outside
          <ul>
            <li>Signage is perceivable. The lettering is big enough and there is adequate lighting.</li>
            <li>Signage is supplemented by understandable icons so that people with a low reading level can still ascertain the information.</li>
            <li>Curb cuts are implemented consistently so that Blind pedestrians can orient themselves.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          Public Transport
          <ul>
            <li>Information about routes and destinations are perceivable. The lettering is big enough and there is adequate lighting.</li>
            <li>Route information is supplemented by understandable icons and images so that people with a low reading level can still ascertain the information.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          Buildings
          <ul>
            <li>The building's approach is designed that Blind people can understand where it is and navigate to it.</li>
            <li>Stairs are textured so that they are usable by Blind people.</li>
            <li>Building materials are chosen that support Blind people's ability to navigate autonomously throughout the space.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h5>Principle #6: Low Physical Effort</h5>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Outside
          <ul>
            <li>Ensure the pathways can be used with reasonable operating forces. Ensure inclined surfaces aren't too smooth and that level differences are only there when necessary. Ensure that paths are not unecessarily uneven or bumpy.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          Public Transport
          <ul>
            <li>Ensure users can approach without using excessive physical effort. Steps aren't too steep, and hopefully aren't necessary for a person to enter the vehicle.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          Buildings
          <ul>
            <li>Users can navigate buildings with low physical effort. Lifts are present, ramps aren't too steep or slippery.</li>
            <li>Doors can be opened and closed with minimal physical effort.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h5>Principle #5: Tolerance for Error</h5>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Outside
          <ul>
            <li>Minimize hazards. Don't provide a ramp that is too steep or slippery. Minimize free obstacles so that Blind people don't easily run into them.</li>
            <li>Provide failsafes, ensure that there is space for users to rest if they have exerted themselves too much.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          Public transport
          <ul>
            <li>  
              Consider that it is often impossible for people to reach a safe space before the vehicle starts to move, and provide failsafes as you can.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          Buildings
          <ul>
            <li>Don't use building materials that are hazardous for people with allergies, cardiac and pulmonary conditions. </li>
            <li>Create stairs and ramps that aren't hazardously steep or slippery both at the building's approach and between the levels within.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h5>Principle #2 Flexibility in Use</h5>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Outside
          <ul>
            <li>Adapt to the user's pace, ensure pedestrians have ample time to cross the road.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          Buildings
          <ul>
            <li>Provide options for access. Some people may be more comfortable with a lift than a ramp.</li>
            <li>Ensure the building is designed in ways that can accomodate individual preferences for furnishing.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h5>Principle #1 Equity of Use</h5>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Outside
          <ul>
            <li>Provide equivelant experiences for users that can walk and users that require assistive technology, for users that are sighted and users that are blind. Where there are differences in levels, or printed signage, there should be alternative ways to navigate and maneuver.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          Public Transport
          <ul>
            <li>Provide equivelant entrance methods for users that can walk and users that require assistive technology, for users that can use stairs and those that cannot. Ensure that all users can benefit from the safety and security features of the vehicle.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          Buildings
          <ul>
            <li>All users should be able to enter a building and access every level and rooom of it. Provide a ramp if there are stairs and do not segregate or stigmatize the users in doing so. Ensuring the building isn't made of material that's bad for those with pulmonary diseases is another step that must be considered.</li>
            <li>All users regardless of disability should be accounted for in the evacuation plans.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>In the third and final section of this document, the authors lays out why integrated approaches (their way to refer to UD) are superior to accomodation-based approaches.</p>

      <p>We don't see much here that the other articles on Universal Design haven't already touched on. The one difference here is that these are policy people trying to argue for the implementation of 'integrated approaches' within standards across Europe. They are really adament that truly everyone benefits from integrated approaches, and that we must move on from making Disabled people 'exceptions to the rule.'</p>

      <blockquote>
        In order to create an accessible environment, it is necessary to approach standard-setting by taking into account limits of uncertainty rather than the â€˜standard averageâ€™. We need to address the relationship between the individual and his environment in broader terms. This means that the range of â€˜normalityâ€™ must be extended: in terms of anthropometry, physical capabilities and psychological characteristics.
        
        Now, an integrated approach can be seen aimed at the anonymous user and allowing differences between individuals to be easily accommodated.
      </blockquote>

      <p>They also stress two more principles that must be followed in order for integrated solutions to be enjoyed equally by all: adaptability and interactivity. This reflects the principle of 'flexibility in use.' Adaptability reflects the ability for people of various disabilities to adapt to the space. Interactivity reflects the ability of Disabled people to go further and customize the space to their liking. </p>

      <h3>Universal Design for Learning</h3>


      <p>I received confirmation that the 2.2 version, not the 3.0 version, is the one that the exam was written up about. I'm going to quickly memorize all of them today. I'm going to over-memorize the points. The BoK lists nine data points; three going to each of the three overall principles: multiple means of representation, multiple means of action and expression, and multiple means of engagement. But each of these nine points actually have something like three to four criteria under them. Thirty-one, to be exact. Thirty one + nine + three is 43 data points, which is almost as big as WCAG Level AA.</p>
      <p>I'm endeavoring to commit all of these to memory not because of the CPACC, but because I am (in my third job) a teacher, and my day job is in education support. So this is important to me. Let's get started.</p>

      <h3>Built Environment and Accessibility</h3>
      <h4>Source: The Body of Knowledge</h4>
      <p>This section emphasizes that the Universal Design principles were designed for the built environment before they were applied to digital environmennts. In built environments, the planning, designing, construction and maintenance are different phases where inclusive principles may be implemented. When we speak of the 'built environments,' we are largely referring to buildings, public spaces, and transportation systems.</p>
      <p>Just as 'shifting left' to incoporate UD in design is less expensive than remediating digital products, the same applies to built environments where retrofitting inaccessible designs is ultimately more expensive than if these prinicples were incoporated in design phase.</p>
      <p>It is common for the 'minimum standards' of national regulations to reflect an 'accomodations' approach over an UD approach. UD is recommended by many countries as a best practice, though it is not a requirement for compliance.</p>

      <p>Some questions that accessibility for the built environment considers might include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>How accessible is entrance and exit from this building?</li>
        <li>How accessible is the evacuation plan from this building?</li>
        <li>How safe is this building for Disabled people?</li>
        <li>How accessible are the individual rooms and floorplans of this building?</li>
        <li>How accessible is navigatory information, such as signs?</li>
        <li>How accessible is this transit route?</li>
        <li>Can Disabled people access this means of transport reliably?</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 id="note-60">CPACC Study Day 11/18: Universal Design for Learning</h2>
      <p>Noted Thursday, November 29, 2024</p>

      <p>I typically like to start the day with a warm up, so let's go with something very difficult and try to make a theme switcher.</p>

      <h3>Theme Switcher</h3>
      <h4>1. <a href="https://fossheim.io/writing/posts/accessible-theme-picker-html-css-js/">Fossheim's Accessible Theme Switcher</a></h4>
      <p>The most confusing part of this tutorial to me is Fossheim's use of localStorage, which I have never heard of.</p>
      <p>The pattern itself uses buttons. These buttons do not seem to be grouped controls. There's no use of a fieldset or of role="group" here, and the instruction 'pick a theme' is not actually programmatically associated with the buttons other than they are all located under a heading (which I suppose does programmatically associate a relationship).</p> 
      
      <p>Fossheim uses vanilla JS to fetch a custom data attribute, 'data-theme' from each of these buttons, and sets CSS selectors to look for those custom data attributes and reset custom colour properties based on which is present.</p>

      <p>They've made a very simple and beautiful thing here. I don't understand all the minute details, but I want to check a few more approaches before I start developing my own.</p>

      <h4>2. <a href="https://www.darins.page/articles/progressively-enhanced-dark-mode">2. Darin's Progressively-enhanced Dark Mode</a></h4>
      <p>Darin's works with and without JS by using a form submit wrapped into a noscript tag. The JS version uses an accessible modal dialogue. The non JS version uses PHP that goes slightly over my head.</p>

      <h4>3. Does details/summary with has() work as a bootstrap toggle?</h4>
      <p>It's a hypothetical that I don't have the requisite experience to deal with. Reading through <a href="https://www.scottohara.me/blog/2022/09/12/details-summary.html">O'Hara's details and summary elements, again</a> blog is enough to tell me that unlike most native HTML elements that have pretty robust support across AT, details/summary is finnicky with lots of niche behaviour. This post is from 2022, but it's still probably very relevant. Very important to know that when summary is exposed as a 'button' as semantics of the 'details' element are scrubbed.</p>

      <p>Lo and behold, someone has already done it. <a href="https://mori.pages.dev/blog/details-hack">Mori.pages.dev</a> has even used it for this exact case: a theme switcher. Mori hasn't put any effort into making the toggle accessible, but I'm curious how Orca reads it. The accessibility tree exposes it with the role of 'summary.'</p>

      <p>Orca/Firefox ESR reads it with 'Theme collapsed button.' Fascinating!</p>
  
      <p>A quick search of 'details/summary hack' also shows experiments by <a href="https://codepen.io/stevef/pen/ExPdNMM">Steve Faulkner on GIF pausing via details/summary</a>. There's also an obligatory warning from <a href="https://adrianroselli.com/2019/04/details-summary-are-not-insert-control-here.html">Adrian Roselli on 'Details/Summary are Not [insert control here]</a>. Though I am curious at the current state of exposure of details/summary, the only way to actually figure this out is manually testing across a bunch of screenreader browser pairings. Might be a worthy project someday, but not today because I need to get into CPACC prep.</p>

      <h3>Universal Design for Learning (UDL)</h3>
      <p>We were exposed to UDL on Day 10 when we saw an instructor from the University of Washington opine about how UDL, UD and WCAG are often not considered in tandem. Let's try to understand what makes UDL antagonistic to UD and WCAG, and whether this is actually the case.</p>

      <h4>Source: Body of Knowledge</h4>
      <p>There are three principles to the UDL. They come from the field of cognitive science and are centered on the 'why', the 'what' and the 'how' of learning.</p>
      <h5>Why Learn?</h5>
      <p>Multiple means of engagement addresses diversity in learner motivation, sustained engagement, and coping skills. Provide options in all three areas.</p>
      <p>For example, provide options along the spectrums of spontaneity to routine, groupwork to solowork.</p>

      <h5>Learn What?</h5>
      <p>Multiple means of representation adresses diversity in preferred learning modality: consider visual, textual, tactile, auditory modes, consider language/symbol use, consider information hierarchy.</p>
      <p>For example, EAL learners or Disabled learners might be restricted in what modes are effective.</p>

      <h5>Learn How?</h5>
      <p>Multiple means of action and expression adresses diversity in the kinds of assignments and tasks that diverse people will prefer. This principle also encompasses the accessibility of the learning environment.</p>
      <p>For example, people might prefer written assignments, other people might prefer presentations.</p>

      <h4>Source: <a href="https://udlguidelines.cast.org/">CAST, UDL Guidelines</a></h4>
      <p>The UDL Guidelines are structures like the WCAG. There are various 'considerations' (their version of success criteria) under nine guidelines.</p>
      <p>However, I actually can't tackle this nine guidelines today, because I don't know which version the exam is going to test on. They recently updated to version 3.0 of the UDLG, but the Body of Knowledge bases itself on the 2.2. I'm going to pause and wait to see what the A11Y slack says before proceeding.</p>

      <h2 id="note-59">Deque University 15/15</h2>
      <p>Noted Wednesday, November 27, 2024</p>
      <p>I'm doing this starting at 23h so it feels like I won't get far. But let's see.</p>
      <h3>Form Labels, Instructions, and Validation</h3>
      <h4>Labels</h4>
      <p>Every form field must have an accessible name, and the semantic HTML label element is the best way to achieve this. The semantic label can be overriden with aria-labelledby and aria-label. According to Deque, placeholders are 'technicaly allowed as a way to provide an accessible name' but I saw a discussion in the A11y slack today where both Eric Eggert and Adrian Roselli noted that they fail instances of a non-persistant visual label. Roselli also linked to this <a href="https://github.com/w3c/wcag/issues/4088">Github issue clarification for 3.2.2</a> that applies in this case.</p>

      <p>In other words, placeholder text can work as an accessible name, satifying 2.5.3. But it fails a different success criteria, 3.2.2, if workarounds aren't provided to ensure that a label is visible at all times. Deque actually corrects itself about placeholders later in the lesson.</p>

      <p>Deque notes that JAWS and VoiceOver will guess at labels if one can't be programmatically determined.</p>

      <p>Deque then goes on to discuss 3.2.2 briefly (it doesn't name SC ever though, which is frustrating as a learner) and it recommends implicit labels as a sufficient technique. But it doesn't warn against the <a href="https://www.stefanjudis.com/notes/input-wrapping-labels-are-not-supported-by-dragon/">Dragon Naturally Speaking bug</a>, which seems a bit off-brand, since Deque typically recommends solutions to VoiceOver-specific bugs.</p>

      <p>Of course, any programmatically associated labels have to be non-generic and non-reliant on sensory characteristics.</p>

      <p>Icons used as labels with no visual text is fine if it is such a widely-recognized symbols like the search icon. Just alt it.</p>

      <p>In most other cases, a visual textual label is required, and the accessible name and visual label must match. It is best practice to ensure the label and input are visually proximal and adjacent within the DOM.</p>

      <p>Deque then discusses a case where form labels and inputs are integrated into a layout table. This is a case were you could associate nonsemantic labels to input fields via aria-labelledby (which can take two ids, by the way). If you do this, associate the nonsemantic labels by putting it into a span. Don't directly assign the id of table headers, apparently, because that gives weird SR behaviour. </p>

      <p>They then present another case where one label is applied to multiple fields, like phone number input that breaks it into 3 smaller fields. Reading this section and their proposed solutions makes me think that it is impossible to do 2.5.3 justice and it's better to just combine it into one form field.</p>

      <h4>Group Labels</h4>
      <p>Use fieldset to group labels. Support for the aria 'group' role is shaky, so do fieldset if you can. You can nest fieldset so there shouldn't be a problem. And by using fieldset, it must have an accessible name, so you also must use legend. As always, labels must be non-generic and non-reliant on sensory characteristics. Everything we've learned up to this point so far applies for group labels.</p>

      <h4>Instructions and Helpful Info</h4>
      <p>To add instructions to a grouped section is tricky, since aria-describedby doesn't work with fieldsets or legends (why?) so we either have the option of appending very brief instructions directly onto the legend itself, or we can associate the instructions to the first field via aria-describedby. All of this is to circumvent the common pattern of just slapping instructions in the middle of the fieldset, as apparently this SR users are very unlikely to perceive the instructions when they are tabbing through fields in Form mode.</p>

      <p>For individual inputs, aria-describedby will suffice. Follow all other presentation directions when it comes to accessible descriptions. Visible, meaningful, non-reliant on sensory characteristics, distinguishable, proximal, programmatically adjacent. </p>

      <p>For required fields in particular, using aria-required="true" provides a failsafe for HTML5's required attribute, whose behaviour is browser-dependent. Providing a visual indicator for required fields is best practice, not conformant. Error messages should also be programmatically assigned via aria-describedby and can be further indicated with aria-invalid="true".</p>

      <p>HTML5.2 has 53 input purposes for UI components. You need to use them on input fields to satisfy 1.3.5 Identify Input Purpose. This is to support autofill functionality. Also the HTML5 autocomplete attribute is helpful.</p>

      <p>Noted Tuesday, November 26, 2024</p>

      <h3>Universal Design Principles</h3>

      <p>Now that I've memorized the principles, time to tackle the other part of Domain Two 3: Describe the goals and benefits of universal design.</p>

      <h4>Source: The Body of Knowledge</h4>
      <p>The UDP date back to 1997 and were created by a multidisciplinary team at North Carolina State University. Universal design is good design, by which everyone benefits when everyone is considered in the design process.</p>
      <blockquote>
        [Universal design] is a fundamental condition of good design, [not a special requirement.]
      </blockquote>

      <h4>Source: <a href="https://universaldesign.ie/about-universal-design">Centre for Excellence in Universal Design</a></h4>

      <p>The link given in the BoK is broken, so I'm just gonna look at a few pages on this website to get an idea.</p>

      <h5><a href="https://universaldesign.ie/about-universal-design/definition-and-overview">Definition and Overview</a></h5>

      <p>Irish law (The Centre for excellence is located in Ireland) has a codified formal definition of universal design, which is the definition that we see everywhere based on the definition section for article two of the UNCRPD. The Centre also mentions Article 4 of the UNCRPD which mandates states to promote research and development of UD products and environments. Also fascinatinly, they provide another synonym for UD/inclusive design/design for all that I haven't seen before: transgenerational design. </p>

      <p>The Centre targets different interventional tactics at the macro, meso and micro levels in an attempt to align with UN Sustainable Development Goals. This model recognizes that the bottom line implements. In other words, individuals are the ones that actual do the work of UD. The macro and meso levels are in service of this individual action through governance and policy making.</p>

      <h5><a href="https://universaldesign.ie/about-universal-design/history-of-universal-design">History of Universal Design</a></h5>

      <p>As a field, UD is an amalgamation of concepts from the following fields: participatory design, human-centered design, asistive technology, and disability-specific design. The Centre calls out 'assistive technology' as its own field. This feels like a call towards the 'functional solutions' model of disability.</p>

      <p>In terms of names, dates, and places, the Centre attributes a large part of focus that was newly given to the needs of Disabled people as being a post-WWII veteran issue. I personally am interested in seeing a bottom-up history of accessibility, I should seek that out. I don't think the IAAP will give it to me.</p>

      <h5><a href="https://universaldesign.ie/about-universal-design/benefits-and-drivers">Benefits and Drivers</a></h5>

      <p>In this section, we see all the familiar talking points. The Centre identifies that everyone across a continuum of ability can benefit from increased usability. They also identify that the population is getting older, and people with disabilities are themselves living longer.</p>
      <p>Independent living is identified as a key priority that enables greater participation in society. The W3C, in their communications, often relay that technology is ultimately an enabler that helps people achieve things that would literally not have been possible otherwise. But the Centre takes a slightly different approach. Society at large is relying increasingly on technology; in places that did not require technology before, technology has become the new norm. In this way, some activities can actually become less accessible due to the introduction of technology. Anecdotally, we can see this very commonly in the elderly populations that struggle with adapting to new tech.</p>

      <p>Market Crossover Success puts a name on phenomonen that we have seen mentioned briefly in other materials. It's where technology initially designed as assistive technology goes mainstream.</p>

      <p>The Centre also names Increased Consumer Expectations and Acceptance at First Use as additional benefits. Especially on the internet, people nowadays take very little time to form a judgement on whether they like a product (less than 50 milliseconds in some cases), and in today's climate, they are more likely to voice their opinions. It's a fraught situation for product makers, the the increase in usability the UD approaches offer can be a North Star in navigating through shifting expectations and norms.</p>

      <h4>Source: <a href="https://www.washington.edu/doit/universal-design-process-principles-and-applications">University of Washington, UD Processes Principles and Applications</a></h4>

      <p>I like everything about this piece except for the introduction, but I understand why it's been written this way, considering the audience is mostly non-specific professionals who are interested in the principles behind UD and may not be familiar with disability culture. It also rattles off 'barrier-free design,' and 'inclusive design' as not being synonymous with universal design. And I don't think that's necessarily accurate. Many definitions of inclusive design are nearly legally synonymous with the ones for UD, so this introduction just seems like it names the other synonyms merely to dunk on them.</p>
      <p>It gives the typical UNCRPD definition, but then gives a more descriptive, simplified, and retroactive definition: that which is accessible, usable and inclusive is considered to meet universal design.</p>
      <p>In addition to naming the seven principles of UD, it also gives the principles of Universal Design for Learning, or UDL. We will cover this in depth later, but suffice for now that there are three principles: multiple means of engagemment, multiple means of representation, and multiple means of action/expression. They also give the four guiding principles of WCAG.</p>

      <p>7 UD principles + 3 UDL principles + 4 WCAG principles gives us 14. With that background established the author finally gets to their argument: these three focuses are not often considered alongside one another. The author presents another schema that their team has developed: Univeral Design in Instruction, that they belive takes into account all 14 principles and synthesizes it into the medium of instruction and pedagogy. It is based on domains: it describes how physical access, delivery methods, information resources, interaction, feedback, assessment, and accomodation should be made to meet universal design principles. By directing the 14 principles at specific practice areas, it makes for easier implementation. The authors also show a small sample workflow for how to apply UD into other domains</p> 

      <h3>Web Content Accessibility Guidelines</h3>
      <p>I skipped over this section (Domain Two C) because I've done so much stuff with WCAG already. I guess it doesn't hurt.</p>
      <h4>Source: Body of Knowldge</h4>
      <p>Web accessiblity is directed at websites, tools and technologies and while it is aimed at Disabled people, non-Disabled people also happen to benefit.</p>

      <p>WCAG 2.2 has 13 main guidelines. I haven't actually memorized them ever, but they seem memorizeable. I should memorize them.</p>

      <p>The thirteen guidelines are</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Text alternatives (1.1)</li>
        <li>Time-based media (1.2)</li>
        <li>Adaptable (1.3)</li>

        <li>Keyboard accessible (2.1)</li>
        <li>Enough Time (2.2)</li>
        <li>Seizures and Physical Reactions (2.3)</li>
        <li>Navigable (2.4)</li>
        <li>Input Modalities (2.5)</li>
        <li>Readable (3.1)</li>
        <li>Predictable (3.2)</li>
        <li>Input Assistance (3.3)</li>
        <li>Compatible (4.1)</li>
      </ol>

      <p>It's a weekend. I'm not going to look at the BoK today. Gonna dip again into the other Deque offerings.</p>

      <h3>Deque: Images, SVG and Canvas</h3>

      <h4>Canvas and Icons</h4>

      <p>Deque doesn't take a position on whether you should or should not use icon-only fonts, or SVG for icons.</p>

      <p>Icons and Canvas elements have to have the role of img. Avoid canvas if you can; SVGs are better. I'm uncomfy with the degree to which Deque upholds aria-label when aria-labelledby is much safer and translates better. All canvas images should have a background fill if changing the background color will obscure text (and changing the background color is WHCM's default behaviour).</p>

      <p>To make Canvas elements keyboard accessible, it is not enough to simply add tab-index="0" to things. You need to satisfy 2.5.3 and ensure keydown events happen. Again, you're making a fake button, so all the considerations for that apply here.</p>

      <h4>Multimedia</h4>
      <p>WebVTT is a cpation format with the most customization features.</p>
      <p>Deque just goes through the WCAG requirements. They emphasize the point that the sole solution for DeafBlind users is a text transcript; NOT captions.</p>

      <p>If you use the object element, it needs an accessible name via aria-labelledby</p>

      <p>PDF files need to be tagged and accessible, as do EPUBS.</p>
      <p>In terms of basic EPUB accessibility tips, ensure you're working in EPUB 3 and reference <a href="https://idpf.github.io/a11y-guidelines/">EPUB 3 Accessibility guidelines</a></p>

        <p>Three nodes go from top right and move counterclockwise. The first node is accompanied by doodle of a person with block shoulders and reads 'neutral. The second node reads 'force: reasonable'. The third node is 'minimize' and has two subnodes: repetitive action, and sustained effort.</p>
        
        <h5>Flexibility (in brown)</h5>
        <p>This map is slightly stylized. Flexibility is written in cursive. At the top, we see 'Choice'! with a drawing of the ASL sign for 'choice' drawn from the first person view. On either side of 'Flexibility' are arrows pointing left and right, labelled 'LH' and 'RH' respectively. Two more nodes outstretch like legs: adapt to pace, and facilitate accuracy. The total effect is for the map to ressemble a person with very long eyelashes.</p>
        <h5>Tolerance for error (blue)</h5>
        <p>The title of the map features bold, 3D block lettering. Nodes start from the bottom right, and go up in an arc. First, the logograph for the toki pona word meaning 'to get rid of' points to some text saying 'hazardous elemens' Secondly, the logograph for the toki pona word meaning 'to add' points to some more text: Warnings, failsafes, most used elements. On the opposite side, some eyes peer above text saying 'discourage unconscious action if you need vigilance!'</p>

        <h5>Simple and intuitive (in citrus)</h5>
        <p>The title of this map is contained in a doodle of a grinning mouth with two dots for eyes. Nodes start at the bottom left and sweep right, as if the mouth is spitting out each one. The first node is 'Complexity &lt Consistancy,' the second is 'Accomodate low literacy!' and the third is 'Effective prompting and feedback.' An additional subnode, 'Information hierarchy' points at the word 'Consistancy.'</p>

        <h5>Equitable use (in purple)</h5>
        <p>There are three primary nodes on this arranged in a pyramid shape. The bottom left node are the words 'Same,' 'Segregate' and 'Stigma' the letter 'S' underlined on each. 'Same' has two additional subnodes forming a pyramid of their own, 'Identical' and 'Equivelant.' The top left node of this map is 'privacy, security, safety. The bottom right node is 'And, appealing!' with a large heart doodle. </p>

        <h5>Perceptible information (in pink!)</h5>
        <p>This mindmap has four nodes arranged in a half circle around the title, that is up against the border of the page. From top to bottom, the first node states 'legible.' The second node is 'different modes for redundant info' with the toki pona symbols for image, word, and tactile. The third node is 'make giving directions easy,' and the fourth is 'compatible with AT' (assistive technology).</p>

        <h5>Size and Space (in red)</h5>
        <p>Size is written in massize capitalized letters and and takes up a full 10th of the page. 'Space' is in tiny lettering underneath. Nodes start bottom left and go all around counter-clockwise. The first node reads 'seated or standing,' and it has two subnodes. The first a long line that zooms past the other maps and settles itself in a corner. It reads,' clear line of sight.' The second child of 'seated or standing' reads 'all components, reachable. The second node is stylized as a hand reaching out from 'SIZE' to give a little wave. It reads 'variation in grip size.' The final node says 'adequate space for AT/ personal assist' and is next to a big empty space that has a dashed border around it, as if it space designated for assistive technology and support.</p>

      <h2 id="note-55">CPACC Study Day 8/18: Benefits of Accessibility</h2>
      <p>Noted Friday, November 22, 2024</p>
      
      <p>Going through and reworking all of the focus and hover styles for the blog before I go ahead and jump into material for today. I'm experimenting with slightly changing the font weight on hover. It's visually quite interesting to me. Might change it back, need to see how this feels. Might be too distracting/too much movement for my own personal taste.</p>
      <h3>Benefits of Accessibility</h3>
      <h4>Source: The Body of Knowledge</h4>
      <p>Two short paragraphs describe a bunch of benefits in a highly condensed form. I'm going to draw it out so I can visualize the whole scope better.</p>
      <h5>Benefits for the Individual with the Access Need</h5>
      <ul>
        <li>Enables participation in education</li>
        <li>Enables participation in employment</li>
        <li>Enables participation in social activities</li>
        <li>Higher health and happiness outcomes</li>
      </ul>
      <h5>Benefits for Individual's Family</h5>
      <ul>
        <li>Reduces dependency and burden of care</li>
        <li>Cost savings</li>
      </ul>
      <h5>Benefits for Community</h5>
      <ul>
        <li>Increased diversity, therefore increased problem-solving ability and innovation</li>
        <li>Improvement to built and digital environment, therefore increased usability</li>
      </ul>
      <h5>Benefits for Nation</h5>
      <ul>
        <li>Cost savings</li>
        <li>GDP increase due to increased labour capacity</li>
      </ul>
      <h4>Source: <a href="http://www.ccdonline.ca/en/socialpolicy/actionplan/accessible-canada">Council of Canadians with Disabilities</a></h4>
      <p>I'm very glad that the BoK curators included this as a part of the reading, but I also feel like this launches into a bunch of political dimensions of Disability and edges into the territory of the Disability Rights movement without providing adequate context.</p>

      <p>We'll read this article with the lense of focusing on the 'benefits of accessibility,' but it's important to note that this article is as much about the need to institute robust welfare projects to support Disabled people to live independent lives, as it is about changing the way we structure our physical and digital environments.</p>

      <p>When the authors from CCD talk about 'accessibility,' they are talking about only 'accessible design,' but 'accessibility' full stop. Accessibility happens when the needs of Disabled people are met.</p>

      <p>Statistics form the backbone of their argument. We learn that people with disabilities face high rates across a variety of metrics: employment, education, poverty and abuse. A large portion of this population require day-to-day support from family members. The current statistics are 'unacceptable in a country as prosperous as canada', the authors argue. Only when Disabled people have the income, assistive technology, support and accomodations that they need, can Disabled people benefit from the nation itself in ways equal with other canadians.</p>


      <p>The argument for accessibile design is pretty simple: it is one building block necessary to create a national culture where Disabled people live equal lives.</p>

      <p>The CDCC has their gaze ardently fixed on the plight of Disabled people in canada, though they also bring up the issue of their caretakers and families. It is only in the last paragraph that they make a more universalized argument.</p>

      <blockquote>
        Committing to a long-term disability strategy is a commitment to building a better Canada for all.
      </blockquote>

      <p>The rhetorical strategies of the authors very closely follow the Human Rights model of Disability. Contrast their communications with most arguments for accessibility that are found within the digital accessibility profession.</p>

      <h4>Source: <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/fundamentals/accessibility-intro/#important">W3C, 'Important for Individuals, Businesses, Society'</a></h4>

      <p>This source is brief and is aimed to convince a general audience. It names access to the digital environment as a 'basic human right' in the UNCRPD, states that accessibility improves the lives of people with disabilites as well as older people, people in rural areas and developing countries. It also mentions the business case, as well as the legal requirement. There's more elaboration on the business section than any other section, but we'll see this fleshed out in even more detail in our next source.</p>


      <h4>Source: <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/business-case/">W3C, 'The Business Case for Digital Accessibility</a></h4>
      <p>I think that on a moral level, and for the sake of progress, we shouldn't have to ever make the case for digital accessibility beyond the human rights-based case. But due to the face that We Live In A Society, this article regretfully exists and may prove to be extremely helpful. Here's their thesis statement:</p>
      <blockquote>
        Businesses that integrate accessibility are more likely to be <strong>innovative</strong>, inclusive enterprises that <strong>reach more people</strong> with positive <strong>brand</strong> messaging that meets emerging global <strong>legal requirements</strong>.
      </blockquote>

      <h5>Innovate</h5>
      <ul>
        <li>Boosted usability</li>
        <li>Human-centered design</li>
        <li>Higher quality UX</li>
        <li>Disability historically drives innovation</li>
        <li>Accessibility is the Future!</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Example: Apple got ahead of the curve on issues of accessibility and now Makes A Lot of Money.</p>
      <p>Example: Google's AI advances got a headstart from their visual context engines initally designed for Blind clients. Auto-complete and voice control also were initially designed for Disabled users.</p>
      <h5>Reach More People</h5>
      <ul>
        <li>7 TRILLION estimated market share for Disabled people</li>
        <li>The market is growing, not shrinking</li>
        <li>Increased loyalty</li>
        <li>People in weird conditions (bright light, slow internet connection) still reachable</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Example: NPR instituted transcripts for all material. Search traffic and unique visitors up 4%-6%.</p>

      <h5>Postive Brand</h5>
      <ul>
        <li>Impression of Corporate Social Responsibility</li>
        <li>Good reputation matters!</li>
        <li>Employees proud to work here</li>
        <li>Contributes to fair company culture</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Example: Barclays implemented a very robust company wide policy, gained a very good reputation as a result.</p>
      <p>Example: Microsoft took made changes after criticism from the Disabled community, now its efforts are praised.</p>
      <h5>Legal Requirements</h5>
      <ul>
        <li>Legal risk increasing over time</li>
        <li>Requirements found all across the globe</li>
        <li>Protect your assets!</li>
        <li>Protect your reputation!</li>
        <li>Mitigate risk!</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Example: ADA lawsuit with Winn-Dixie lost their case, establishing precedent that Title III of the ADA is relevant in digital environments/websites and e-commerce.</p>

      <h4>Source: <a href="https://www.section508.gov/blog/benefits-accessible-design/">Section 508, Benefits of Accessible Design</a></h4>

      <p>This source is similarly concerned with making pragmatic arguments that will appeal to business leaders. Very similar to 'The Business Case for Digital Accessibility,' but the rhetorical strategy is gives sligthly more agency to Disabled people themselves. As a result, it's a better-formed article.</p>

      <p>The argument is broken into three sections.</p>

      <h5>1. More Customers</h5>
      <ul>
        <li>71% of Disabled users will leave inaccessible products</li>
        <li>There are so many Disabled people.</li>
        <li>There are so many Disabled people for whom web accessibility is important (USA numbers)
          <ul>
            <li>20 million manual dexterity</li>
            <li>8 million visual disabilities</li>
            <li>8 million auditory disability</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h5>2. Cost Savings</h5>
      <ul>
        <li>Disability can happen at any time. Retain your talent!</li>
        <li>More Traffic = More Revenue</li>
        <li>Cost of Accessible Design &lt Cost of Remediation + Litigation</li>
      </ul>
      <h5>3. Innovation</h5>
      <ul>
        <li>Usable products = increase productivity for everyone</li>
        <li>Encourages 'establishing a social vision'</li>
        <li>Disabled people coping with barriers take on an innovative mindset every day. They can be valuable assets to your company!</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 id="note-54">CPACC Study Day 7/18: Universal Design</h2>
      <p>Noted Thursday, November 21, 2024</p>
      <p>As normal, we'll start iwth a bit of a warmup before jumping into CPACC prep. I'm now almost totally turned off by the Deque course. I'll actually just be reviewing directly from the BoK from now on, with the intention to focus on the goal areas that I identified in Goal-Setting #2.</p>
      
      <h3><a href="https://tarnoff.info/2024/11/18/a11y-101-wcag-1-2-2-captions-prerecorded/">Nat Tarnoff on Captions, WCAG SC 1.2.2</a></h3>
      <p>Tarnoff makes the argument here that captions are accessible to DeafBlind people. Everything that I've read here suggests that this is not the case, but I think Tarnoff may be conflating transcripts and captions? There are separate WCAG requirements for providing transcripts for precisely this reason: SC 1.2.3 Audio Description or Media Alternative (Prerecorded) which is a Level A criterion, and SC 1.2.8 Media Alternative (Prerecorded), which is a Level AAA criterion.</p>
      <p>Tarnoff isn't wrong that captions are real text. But they are typically not in a format that is super friendly to access directly as such: they have a bunch of timestamp notations and metadata that is important for the computer to know, but distracting for the user.</p>
      <p>The other reason it is important to distinguish between captions and transcripts is because transcripts (at least, descriptive captions) also contain visual information, while captions do not. Caption authors regularly assume that the person using them has access to visual information. For example, if the person who is speaking is visible on screen, the captioner will typically give a blank attribution to that speaker (won't designate who the speaker is) while transcribers must always notate who is talking when.</p>
      <p>So when Tarnoff gives the false impression that captions provide access to DeafBlind people, that's a potentially harmful idea that gives captions more credit for what they are worth, and nearly excuses people from putting the extra mile in to include accessible, descriptive transcripts.</p>
      <p>Also skeptical of this article because Tarnoff tags the post with the words 'hearing impaired.' In most contexts, one should almost never say these two words together. This is at the request of the Deaf community, though there are many people with auditory disabilities that don't fit neatly there and might expressly prefer the term.</p>

      <h3>Individual Accomodations vs Universal Design</h3>
      <h4>Source: The Body of Knowledge</h4>
      <p>The text of the BoK offers us surprisingly little. They link together the concept of Universal Design along with several of extentions to the initial idea: Inclusive design, Design for all, Human-centered design, and Life-span design. The BoK points out that this framework is popular in Europe, pointing to the EN 17161:2016 Design for All standard.</p>
      <p>Accessibility is positioned as being closely related to universal design. Where Accessibility is primarily focused on Disabled people, Universal design doesn't have as specific as a scope (perhaps internationaliztion could also fit under this framework). Usability is also adjacent to these two ideas with emphasis on 'ease of use' though it does not consider accessibility barriers as part of this equation by default.</p>
      <p>Accessibility may need a bit more than universal design in order to be achieved. Certain specific accomodations may be needed at times-- these are known as individualized accommmodations. The Body of Knowledge argues that universal design can reduce the ammount of individualized accomodations that need to be implemented.</p>

      <p>Now, let's look at the linked resources.</p>

      <h4>Source: <a href="http://www.inclusivedesigntoolkit.com/whatis/whatis.html">University of Cambridge, What is Inclusive Design?</a></h4>

      <p>Relevant to our studies is the subheading 'Comparison with 'Universal Design'' that makes the claim that within the context of web design, inclusive design and universal design as well as 'design for all' are essentially synonyms.</p>
      
      <p> The distinction lays in that inclusive design always first identifies a target population into account and designs with them in mind. Universal design' never considers a target population other than the general population</p>

      <p>This source argues that the inclusive design philosophy is more pragmatic, and perhaps more honest. It recognizes that there are times where it is more appropriate to target a more specialized population within the development of a product, because financial constraints limit how truly 'universalizing' experiences can be.</p>

      <blockquote>
        Inclusive design does not suggest that it is always possible (or appropriate) to design one product to address the needs of the entire population
      </blockquote>

      <p>Inclusive design partially demands that specialized products and design are produced and incorporated into the inital product development cycle, producing an inclusive product family that includes specialized versions.</p>
      <p>We can think of this kind of approach as being less remedial in nature, and more following the 'provide comparable experience' axiom within the <a href="https://inclusivedesignprinciples.info/">seven Inclusive Design Principles.</a></p>

      <h4>Source: <a href="https://www.dol.gov/agencies/odep/program-areas/employers/accommodations">Accomodations under the ADA</a></h4>

      <p>From the US Department of Labour, we are introduced to the idea of 'accomodation.' By nature, accommodations are modification appended to the original design of the workflow or environment. Hence they are not within the same frame as 'Universal Design.' The Department of Labour does touch on the fact that all employees, and not just the employee that the modification is instituted for, can benefit from the accommodation.</p> 
      
      <p>This doesn't really require employers to take the initiative to anticipate potential barriers that might arise, and the entire onus to initiate the accomodation falls onto the Disabled employee or job applicant. Sometimes this approach is most appropriate. Think about it; it would be weird to provide live ASL interpretation for every single interview if neither the interviewer or interviewee knew ASL.</p>

      <h4>Source: <a href="https://www.washington.edu/doit/universal-design-vs-accommodation">University of Washington, Universal Design vs Accomodation</a></h4>
      <p>Fascinating. This source defines Universal Design with the exact same wording that the British Standards Institute uses to define Inclusive Design. Just goes to show how inseparable these two ideas are, and how little space they've had to grow into separate concepts on a macro-level.</p>

      <p>The University of Washington is specifically concerned with the domain of education and seemingly also specifically includes EAL speakers as a beneficiary of Universal Design.</p>

      <blockquote>
        For example, designing web resources in accessible formats as they are developed means that no re-development is necessary if a blind student enrolls in the class. Planning ahead can be less time-consuming in the long run.
      </blockquote>

      <p>As the other sources corroborate, Universal Design is a planning technique, not a remedial technique.</p>

      <h4>Source: <a href="https://www.washington.edu/doit/what-difference-between-accessible-usable-and-universal-design">University of Washington: Accessible, Usable and Universal Design</a></h4>

      <p>This article compares accessible design, usable design, and universal design as 'similar though distinct concepts.'</p>

      <p>Universal design is defined just as it is defined in the UW's other article on the subject.</p>

      <p>Accessible design is presented as design focused on the needs of Disabled people. The source puts extra emphasis on the 'compliance' framework of accessibility as introduced by things like the ADA and Section 508.</p>

      <p>Meanwhile, Usable design focuses on effectiveness, efficiency, consistancy, and satisfaction with which user flows can be seen out. There is no primary focus on accessibility. In fact, Disabled users are often left out and not a consideration. The UW acknowledges that within the Usability sphere, this is slowly changing. More and more usability advocates are waking up to the need to consider accessibility as well, and to include Disabled users in their usability tests.</p>

      <h4>Source: <a href="https://www.un.org/development/desa/disabilities/convention-on-the-rights-of-persons-with-disabilities/article-2-definitions.html"> UNCRPD Article 2 Definitions</a></h4>

      <p>Again, we see the same definition of Universal Design (Britain uses the same definition to define Inclusive Design). I'll present it here in full. It comes up often enough to be worth commiting fully to memory</p>

      <blockquote>
        the design of products, environments, programmes and services to be usable by all people, to the greatest extent possible, without the need for adaptation or specialized design
      </blockquote>

      <p>It also defines 'reasonable accomodation' as modification when needed in particular cases, with the 'reasonable' caveat referring to the fact that the modification should 'not impose disproportionate or undue burden.'</p>

      <h4>Source: <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/fundamentals/accessibility-usability-inclusion/">W3C Accessibility Fundamentals: Accessibility, Usability, Inclusion</a></h4>

      <p>In 'Distinctions and Overlaps,' W3C describes explicitly defines 'Inclusion' to go beyond just accessibility. It includes quality of technology, digital skills, classs and socioeconomic barriers, geographical, demographic and language barriers. 'Accesibility' describes only one kind of barrier in this grand kaleidescope of potential perception issues: those barriers that are encountered because a person is Disabled.</p>

      <p>Usability is all about user experience design and is a field that largely excludes the unique experiences of Disabled people. But 'Usability's tenants of ensuring product design is effective, efficient and satisfying, are important ideas to port over into the realm of accessibility. Accessibility typically has the effect of improving usability for everyone, so the fields are theoretically very complementary. In practice, Usability as a field and culture has not gotten to a point where it sees Accessibility as a part of its purvue.</p>

      <p>The article suggests also that some accessibility efforts are too focused in the technical aspects, and that 'human interaction aspect[s are] often lost.' The authors suggest 'Usable Accessibility' as a paradigm where usability and accessibility are harmonious concepts integrated at product conception, not just left to the technical remedialists after the product has already gone live.</p>

      <p>This page has little to offer except to present 'Design for All' as a synonym for 'Universal Design.' The page offers no distinction between these two concepts and doesn't really add anything that we haven't covered up to this point.</p>

      <h3>Interlude</h3>
      <p>Utterly heartbroken that Sins Invalid's website is inaccessible and uses an Overlay. I'm so heartbroken.</p>
      <p>I also watched Molly describe a whole bunch of cool things about Braille and Blind education! <a href="https://youtu.be/a8AEkwtNEiM">Molly Burke's Introduction to Braille</a> Quite a revealing video. I learned a lot. It cheers me up, I guess!</p>

      <p>Noted Tuesday, November 19, 2024</p>

      <p>Rainy day today. Standing outside in the wet for a while made me lose quite a few spoons. But the show continues!</p>
  
      <h3>
        <a href="https://a11yrules.com/podcast/e094-interview-with-devon-persing-part-1/">Devon Persing on 'Compliance' and Alternatives</a>
      </h3>
      <p>Recently, I've been starting out with palate cleansers like this. Reading through this transcript (hell yeah for transcripts!), it was comforting to see a person coming from a non-tech background talk about their experience. I want to read Devon's book (maybe when I actually see a cent or two come from this endeavor!). I keep seeing Adrian Roselli posting about reading it on his Kobo, accompanied by artisan coffee. It's so freaking tempting.</p>
      <p>In terms of actual takeaways from this, it's true that compliance is a poor model to rely on when we're talking about scaling up solutions. Compliance is something that you designate to a 'compliance team.' It's not culture, and it's not a mindset shift.</p>
      <p>Personally I don't think the WCAG is necessarily at odds with the whole culture thing. Devon talks about the WCAG as stale. I, personally, find it to be a very intruiging document and not stale at all. Things like <a href="https://www.andrewhick.com/accessibility/wcag-map/">Andrew Hick's Train Station WCAG map</a> prove to me that we can make the WCAG engaging to a popular audience. But Devon's right that the driving force behind implementing accessibility policies has to be routed in frameworks of inclusion and usability, not over legal liability concerns. Rooted not in fear, but curiosity and love for our relatives and future selves.</p>
      <p>Hard to do in a corporate setting. Major props to Devon for all the valuable work she does.</p>

      <h3>Deque CPACC Prep Course</h3>
      <h4>Colour Blindness</h4>
      <p>Forms of colour blindness include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Red-green color blindness (Deuteranopia and Protanopia are common conditions)</li>
        <li>Blue-yellow color blindness (Tritanopia)</li>
        <li>Total insensitivity/grayscale (Achromatopsia)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Barriers in the ICT Domain include</p>
      <ul>
        <li>When the option to enable custom color combinations is not available, so enable it!</li>
      </ul>
      <p>General Barriers include</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Cases when certain color combinations can be difficult to distinguish, so don't design materials that require this distinction to be meaningful!</li>
      </ul>
      <h4>DeafBlindness</h4>
      <p>General barriers include</p>
      <ul>
        <li>DeafBlind people being unable to communicate through sight or sound. Deque doesn't really have a great understanding of 'tactile sign language,' but to be fair, this is a very rapidly evolving space. Even users of the most traditional forms of tactile sign language do not restrict their signs and gestures to the hands. Tactile forms of communication are much more envolved and include things like the back, arms, chest, lap.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Barriers in the ICT Domain include</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Digital text cannot be seen or heard. But a screen reader can convert text and text alternatives to audio onto a refreshable Braille display, or printed via braille embosser.</li>
        <li>Visual and auditory feedback is not received, but haptic alerts can be received, so use that!</li>
      </ul>

      <h4>Auditory</h4>
      <p>'Auditory' as in referring to Deafness, HOH and central Auditory Processing Disorder.</p>

      <p>Barriers in the ICT domain</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Audio content cannot be heard. Lots of solutions here and they will depend on whether the content is live or pre-recorded, as well as the preferences of the Deaf person, and what kind of medium it is. Options here include syncrhonized captions, sign language interpretation, signed interpretation, CART/STTR.</li>
      </ul>
      <h4>Momentary Interlude</h4>
      <p>I'm noticing that the Deque course actually offers less content, and sometimes inaccurate content, as opposed to the BoK. I think I'll pause taking notes from the Deque course on these domains, and move to just consuming it passively.</p>
      <p>Scanning through. They present mobility disabilities as like.. look at these people! They look like they're stupid and they're not! Just horrific. Also not a fan of the presentation of cognitive abilities. I feel like it would be easy to just hire someone to do a once-over of this.</p>

      <p>NOOOO not the dyslexia simulation!!</p>

      <p>Uses outdated language for nonspeaking people. <a href="https://stimpunks.org/glossary/nonspeaking/">Resource on 'Nonspeaking' vs 'nonverbal'</a>. 'Mute' is actually considered pretty offensive, 'mutism' is quite clinical and isn't often how people describe their own experiences. This <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/disability/comments/1gcs041/is_mute_the_correct_term_to_use_for_someone_who/">Reddit thread on 'mute'</a> provides a range of perspectives.</p>
      <p>I feel like a person certified as an 'accessibility professional' should at least be counted on to get the language right?</p>
      <p>Uh, I think people would object to sign language being categorized as AAC. <a href="https://www.in.gov/health/cdhhe/files/Augmentative-and-Alternative-Communication-Considerations.pdf#:~:text=Single%20sign%20use%20and%20gestures%20may%20be,natural%2C%20fully%20formed%20language%20of%20its%20own.">PDF on the difference between AAC and ASL</a>. It is likely not accessible so I'll summarize briefly here:</p>
      <p>Sign languages are languages. They are full ass languages. AAC refers to non-language communication. It's like referring to reading via Braille or audiobook as 'not being reading' because the medium is different. It's a very ableist assertion.</p>
      <p>Signs used outside of the context of a language system *might* be considered AAC, especially if the signs are completely made up and not from a pre-existing sign language. But the line is so thin that I would advocate not lumping sign under AAC altogether. Consider, would you say that 'speaking' is a form of AAC if a child only knew how to vocalize 'help' and 'milk'? Likely not!</p>
      <p>Be vigilant against ableism, people!</p>
      <p>Deque, why is your content borderline ableist?</p>
      <p>It is so mentally exhausting to chug through this, I swear to God.</p>
      <p>(This is purely Deque riffing, btw. The IAAP does not share Deque's very ableist definition of AAC).</p>

      <h3>Interlude</h3>
      <p>I took the 'Fast Track for Web Accessibility: Developers' Exam out of curiosity. I finished it in 11 minutes and got 100%.</p>

      <h2 id="note-52">CPACC Study Day 5/18: Types of Disabilities</h2>
      <p>Noted Monday, November 18, 2024</p>
      <p>Going in with Deque again today. Before jumping into CPACC prep, I want to finish off the outstanding module that I have 11% left on. </p>
      <h3>Designing an Accessible User Experience</h3>
      <p>(Not CPACC things)</p>
      <p>The ATAG 2.0 is divided into two sections: make the authoring tool accessible, and support the production of accessible content.</p>
      <p>Whenever there is a fully automatic process, ensure it produces accessbile cotent. Pre-made templates should be accessible. Don't have your content filters erase accessible features. Ensure that accessible content production is possible, either by making all widgets accessible, or giving user full control over the HTML. Support, assist, and guide authors in authoring content with accessible non-text alternatives, and help them repair accessibility problems that do arise.Make accessibility the default, and built into the natural flow of the authoring process. Ensure that help features can instruct people on how to implement good accessible content.</p>
      <p>Automated solutions, according to Deque, have potential. They are leaps and bounds above where they initally were, but they still cannot be relied on completely. Human-authored transcripts, captions, alt text and audio descriptions are still the gold standard. Deque is optimistic that the general trend of 'improvement' for these features will hold steady.</p>

      <h3>Interlude: Fast Track to Accessibility for Designers</h3>
      <p>I saw that I have taken most modules related to the 'Designers' program, so I curiously took the Fast Track to Accessibility for Designers exam. I got 96% and it took me 25 minutes of the 120 minutes allotted.</p>
      <p>That felt slightly vindicating. At least I can objectively say that I have learned something in these past months. Imposter syndrome is super real and difficult to navigate.</p>
      <p>For example, my brain is currently yelling at me saying that I should have been able to finish it in 10 minutes and that I'm stupid for taking a whole 25 minutes. My brain can be scary sometimes.</p>

      <h3>Types of Disabilities</h3>
      <p>I covered a good portion of Disability types on Days 1 and 2, so I'm mostly going to focus on new information that I feel I haven't been exposed to before.</p>

      <h4>Vision: Blindness</h4>

      <p>Deque goes a head and names some specific causes of Blindness including diabetes, macular degeneration, glaucoma, accidents/injuries, strokes, and retinitis pigmentosa. They also describe the legal definition of blindness in the US which has to deal with</p>

      <blockquote>
        visual acuity of 20/200 with corrective lenses or who has a field of vision (what can be seen in front of the person) that is 20 degrees in the eye that has the best vision
      </blockquote>

      <p>Fascinating, so there's actually two kinds of blindness here. One of which has a tiny field of vision (kind of like that guy, Paul, on TikTok that keeps on getting pranked by his husband) and the complete loss of visual acuity kind (kinda like Christine Ha from Masterchef).</p>

      <p>Deque then talks about the Challenges and Solutions that Blind people encounter across a range of domains.</p>
      
      <p>In the ICT domain</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Lack of textual alternatives are the challenge. Just.. provide them!</li>
        <li>Tools that are not keyboard-accessible are the challenge. Just... make them keyboard accessible!</li>
        <li>They can't see the digital interface (not just computers; think ATMs, kiosks, printers, copiers, GPS). The solution here is to use screen-readers (though I've never seen a screen-reader being used on an airport kiosk before. I'm flying soon, so I will take a peak!)</li>
        <li>The screen readers can't provide access if the content/interface wasn't designed to work with them. So make your coded interfaces and content compatible!</li>
      </ul>

      <p>In the Built Environment/Architecture domain</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Blind people can't see while walking. These solutions can help Blind people navigate their surroundings without sight: canes, service animals, GPS with an audio interface, remote human navigators, raised tiles to indicate environmental elements, get rid of low-hanging things, clear pathways.</li>
        <li>Blind people can't signs of text within the built enviornment. These solutions can them orient regardless: Map applications, Braille labels that are placed in intuitive places (only helps people who know Braille, which is a minority), tactile models of buildings and floorplans, tools that provide descriptions (either through AI or human-aided things like Be My Eyes).</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Consumer & Industrial Products</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Flat interfaces on devices like microwaves, ovens, are not accessible. Ideally, used interfaces with tactile controls like knobs and buttons. Audio interfaces, or remote control through a mobile device can be secondary solutions.</li>
        <li>Blind people can't read the text on consumer packaging. Embossed braile and braille stickers can help. I imagine tools that provide descriptions also help.</li>
        <li>Blind people can't read money to determine its value. In canada or other places that have accessible cash, this isn't really a problem. Non cash systems are another solution, as are applications on mobile devices that can photograph cash, and return the value of that cash.</li>
        <li>Blind lieople can't read printed materials. Digital formats are great. Optical character recognition can convert scanned images into readable text.</li>
      </ul>

      <h4>Vision: Low Vision</h4>

      <p>Some conditions are named here as well including cataracts, disabetic retinopathy, glaucoma, hemianopia, macular degeneration, and retinal detachment. It actually specifics names how these conditions manifest.</p>

      <p>Some low vision types include</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Cataracts, where dark grey blind spots cloud the vision
        </li>
        <li>Diabetic retinopathy, where floating dark spots appear (kinda looks like seeing dark shadows caused by clouds when you're flying)</li>
        <li>Glaucoma results in a kind of tunnel vision.</li>
        <li>Hemianopia slices whole sides of your vision off.</li>
        <li>Macular degeneration have loss of vision at the center of the eye, but retains peripheral vision.</li>
        <li>Retinal detachment can have flashes of light, dark debris floating, and dark shadows obfuscating significant parts of vision.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Domain: General</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Small text can be hard to read. For printed text, alternative large print versions can help, as can alternative digital versions. For digital text, screen magnifiers, styling utilities, even screen readers can help.</li>
        <li>Low contast text can be hard to read. Solve this by choosing colour palettes with high contrast! People with low vision can also use software options to enhance to contrast of digital text.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Domain: ICT</p>
      <ul>
        <li>No options to set up custom color combinations can pose a barrier, so always allow the user to choose (don't override their stylesheets)</li>
        <li>Ensure content can be resized! It can be a barrier if you disallow this, or don't design with proper reflow in mind.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 id="note-51">Goal Setting #2</h2>
      <p>Noted Monday, November 18, 2024</p>
      
      <p>Confetti! Today's the benchmark that I set for my first goal-setting session, where I decided on a bunch of things I wanted to accomplish. So I'm sat at a cafe with a five-dollar latte ready to reflect, celebrate, and plan for the next one!</p>

      <h3>Reflections</h3>

      <p>I only ended up completing one and a half Dquecourses out of the five I wanted to complete, but I don't feel so bad about that. The month of November has been the most productive month by far: I spent 24 hours working in the first week, and 20 hours in the second week.</p>

      <p>The majority of this time was spent either doing case studies, or learning CSS. This is the kind of stuff that doesn't end up on my blog. But I also spent a lot of time blogging: We're now at 50 notes, and 30k words!</p>

      <p>Throughout this time, I've gotten some solid fundamentals in flexbox. I also had an important trajectory switch: preparing for CPACC!</p>

      <p>Back to those four courses that I didn't manage to complete: the trajectory switch had a lot to do with this. These courses are not relevant to the CPACC, they're actually preparatory materials for the WAS. There were moments where I was overwhelmed with the technical knowledge that they suddenly sprang on me, but I do want to keep this up somewhat and not abandon them entirely.</p>

      <p>It's shaping up to be that I am concentrating on three things: auditing skills, CSS/HTML skills, and WCAG/IAAP skills. From this point of view, it makes sense to me to formulate my new goals as such:</p>

      <h3>New Goals due December 6:</h3>

      <h4>Auditing Skills</h4>
      <p>Completely finish auditing report and remediation work with [redacted].</p>
      <p>Find a new project.</p>
      <h4>CSS/HTML Skills</h4>
      <p>Completely remake [redacted]'s website, ensure it is fully functional.</p>
      <h4>CPACC Prep</h4>
      <p>Take notes on the entirety of Deque's preparatory course.</p>
      <p>Completely memorize material for the following units:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Domain 1A</li>
        <li>Domain 2A-F</li>
        <li>Domain 3A</li>
        <li>Domain 3F</li>

      <h3>Print Styles for this Blog</h3>

      <p>I'm trying to get my header/nav to display none and it's not working? May have been a one-off. Found how to toggle on 'print syle' emulation in the Firefox Inspector, so this should make it easier.</p>
      <p>Roselli's blog is a really good resource for this stuff. I'm starting off with <a href="https://adrianroselli.com/2013/09/my-wordcamp-buffalo-2013-presentation.html">Roselli's 2013 presentation on print styles at WordCamp Buffalo</a>. I've got the default style to be okay. Still need to find a mechanism to print links, but I can do that later.</p>

      <h3>The Deque CPACC Prep Course</h3>
      <p>I started this a little while ago, but I'm revisiting everything. I *could* go around critiquing every little part of this for not being in line with how Disability Justice advocates navigate their lives. But on this first pass, it makes more sense to me to just blindly eat the content, and save my thoughts for later. For example, right off the bat, the course assumes that the person taking it is sighted.</p>
      <blockquote>
        What if I handed you a blank newspaper? Would you be able to read it? Giving a blind person a newspaper is just as useless as giving a sighted person a blank newspaper.
      </blockquote>
      <p>But I'm not going to comment on why this approach is faulty. Let's just get on with it.</p>

      <h4>Background</h4>
      <h5>Assistive Technology</h5>
      <p>Like a wheelchair, hearing aid, cane, corrective lenses. For the web, these encompass screen readers, refreshable braille devices, screen enlargers, color enhancement overlays, captions, transcripts, head wand, mouth stick, alternative keyboards, eye gaze tracking, voice activation, AAC devices. But work best in environments that are designed for them.</p>
      <h5>The Solution</h5>
      <p>The web has enormous capacity to support the independence of Disabled people. Disabled people may rely more on the web than on other formats (some disabilities functionaly limit someone so that certain activites are accomplishable only through the web), so it is <strong>absolutely crucial</strong> that accessibility is incoporated into the web.</p>

      <h4>Theoretical Models of Disability</h4>
      <h5>Medical Model</h5>
      <ul>
        <li>Diagnosed biological condition limiting quality of life needing professional intervention.</li>
        <li>Determines eligibility for benefits/legal rights.</li>
        <li>Good: Grounded in biology streamlines medical/legal processes.</li>
        <li>Bad: Unconcerned with accessibility, brands a label onto an individual (stigma), diagnostic criteria often unflexible, often requires documentation (exhausting to need to 'prove').</li>
      </ul>
      <p>External links are provided for further study, I'm putting them aside for now.</p>

      <h5>Social Model</h5>
      <ul>
        <li>A condition where the world is not built accessibly, resulting in barriers.</li>
        <li>Direct response by advocates to the medical model, champions human rights.</li>
        <li>Environments can either be 'enabling' or 'disabling'</li>
        <li>Good: 'removes stigma,' puts responsibility on society to fix things</li>
        <li>Bad: can create a new kind of stigma; it should not be disempowering to talk about biological conditions</li>
      </ul>  
      <h5>Biopsychosocial Model</h5>
      <ul>
        <li>Recognizes biological, individual and social aspects of diability.</li>
        <li>Good: Useful in creating robust, multi-faceted treatment plans.</li>
        <li>Bad: These resulting plans might downplay medical needs.</li>
      </ul>
      <h5>Economic Model</h5>
      <ul>
        <li>Economically, disabled people are not as economically productive in the eyes of the state and the workplace.</li>
        <li>Lower profit margins in terms of productivity, increased cost in terms of care and welfare.</li>
        <li>Good: We live in capitalism and we can't just not consider this.</li>
        <li>Bad: Disabled people viewed as being 'needy' and leeches on the budget. Disabled people who can work don't fit into the model.</li>
      </ul>
      <h5>Functional Solutions Model</h5>
      <ul>
        <li>Laser-focused on how to improve quality of life through technology and methodology.</li>
        <li>Not interested in sociopolitical aspects of disability.</li>
        <li>Good: Good at getting things done because there's no hang-up on 'politics;</li>
        <li>Bad: Can miss opportunities to incoporate/better the larger social context. </li>
      </ul>
      <h5>Social Identity or Cultural Affiliation Model</h5>
      <p>I have so much I want to add here because this seems like such an inaccurate way to present this but I will fucking bite my tongue.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Disabled people have affiliation based on shared experiences.</li>
        <li>Deaf culture is a good example of this.</li>
        <li>Good: Identity is good for mental health, offers opportunities for group action/political strength.</li>
        <li>Bad: No biological basis means weird membership composition, identity is defined negatively and formed through 'exclusion'</li>
      </ul>
      <h5>Charity/Tragedy Model</h5>
      <p>I also think that in leaving out economic and historical context, Deque fundamentally miscommunicates this but whatever.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Disabled people viewed as objects of pity, assumed to be incapable.</li>
        <li>Good: can encourage empathy amongst temporarily abled folk.</li>
        <li>Bad: Encourages unequal socioeconomic and political relationships between temporarily abled and Disabled folk.</li>
      </ul>
      <h5>Other Models</h5>
      <ul>
        <li>Affirmation: adds Disability Pride to the social identity/cultural affiliation model.</li>
        <li>Sociopolitical: Emphasizes need for human rights.</li>
        <li>Religious/Moral: Disability is a 'gift' or punishment from God.</li>
        <li>Expert: Disabilities require professional intervention and treatment.</li>
        <li>Rehabilitation: Seeks to functionally rehabilitate a person through medical intervention.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Interlude: Deque's 'Designing an Accessible User Experience' Course</h3>
      <p>This course is actually surprisingly good. It talks about non-technical aspects of accessibility work, mostly through the lense of inclusive design. I wish that all the courses that dealth with non-technical aspects were similar to this one. This was clearly designed by a UX accessibility specialist (they even refer to themselves in the first person a few times). I wish that the sections on things like Disability studies were written from people in the field.</p>

      <p>I started coverng this in my Anki Deck yesterday and was immediately intruiged as to what supplemental resources they want us to rely on, so I'll be reformulating my thoughts on everything here.</p>

      <h3>In Brief</h3>

      <p>There are seven models: medical, social, biopsychosocial, social identity, functional, charity, and economic.</p>

      <p>In the most brief terms, the seven models each answer the question, what are disabled people? These are my personal definitions <strong>before</strong> engaging with the supplemental sources referenced in the Body of Knowledge</p>

      <dl>
        <dt>Medical model</dt>
        <dd>Disabled people are biologically disadvantaged.</dd>
        <dt>Social model</dt>
        <dd>Disabled people are would not be disadvantaged if society had the means to properly accomodate them.</dd>
        <dt>Biopsychosocial</dt>
        <dd>Disabled people suffer doubly from their biological reality and by society's construction.</dd>
        <dt>Social Identity</dt>
        <dd>Disabled people are a group that share a common past of resilience in the face of ableist eugenics and a common future creating a shared world where we can flourish within our medical realities.</dd>
        <dt>Functional Solutions</dt>
        <dd>Disabled people are clients that will buy devices that relieve symptoms and alleviate barriers.</dd>
        <dt>Charity model</dt>
        <dd>Disabled people are unfortunate dependents on the benevolence of holy non-disabled actors.</dd>
        <dt>Economic model</dt>
        <dd>Disabled people are unproductive leeches and an economic drain on the nation.</dd>
      </dl>
      <p>I am of the belief that the social identity model has the capacity to absorb other aspects of different models into it, and should be the starting point for any operation that seeks to influence our lives, including accessibility. It's the only definition that isn't ahistorical and centers self-determination.</p>

      <h3>Supplemental: <a href="https://www.disabled-world.com/definitions/disability-models.php">Disabled World Website</a></h3>

      <p>This has much more models than the seven we're supposed to memorize, but broadly, they can be presented as subtypes.</p>
      <p>Into the medical model, we can add the 'Biomedical' model, which has more of a focus on the actual biology than the capacity of modern medicine to be the arbiter of disability itself. To the functional solutions model, we can add the 'Market Model' which views Disabled people with slightly more agency, as empowered consumers with a hand in shaping company and also national policy. The 'Empowering model' operates in this consumerist paradigm, but the focus is more on the actual benefit that this brings to the individual's life and the capacity they have to decide on the unique treatment plan that they will benefit best from. The 'Expert/Professional Model' straddles in between the medical and functional consumer models, and tasks experts with the work of 'solving' disability through treatment and research; the Disabled people themselves are passive in this paradigm.</p>
      <p>The social identity model is manifested under a couple of subtypes with different concentrations: the 'Minority model' is much closer to my personal definition of the social identity model where the group consistutes a separate social category like any other forms of minoritization (gender, race, orientation). The 'Affirmation model's intervention is to view the Disabled identity as an overall positive one.</p>

      <p>Four of the models are strategies to improve the lives of Disabled people through systems change. The "Relational model" emerged in the context of institutionalization and emphasizes integrated communites and social inclusion. The "Diversity model" speaks to idea that niche solutions are required and universal design is not sufficient or flexibile enough to achieve good outcomes for the entire Disabled population. The "Human Rights model" seeks to enshrine the equal participation of Disabled people into law, and using law as the basis of changing the system instead of targetting deficiency-based societal mindsets first. The 'Social Adapted model' puts the entire onus of 'negative' Disabled experiences onto society's failure to adapt and accomodate.</p>

      <p>Three more subtypes either support or enhance the charity model. The 'Religious model' views the imposition of disability on an individual as an act of punishment by God that can be potentially alleviated through prayer. The 'Moral model' is a variation of this that believes that the Disabled person is to blame for their own disability. The reasons for this can be religious or spiritual like in the 'Religious' model, or through things like poor lifestyle choices. Whatever the cause, they are viewed as moral failings for which the Disabled person justly received the 'punishment.' The 'Sick Role model' prescribes that a Disabled person take on the social role of the 'sick individual' and perform behaviours in line with that role to access care. This compliments the charity model nicely, which assumes that all Disabled people are in desperate need of help and direction from people with priviledge.</p>

      <h3>Supplemental: <a href="https://www.ombudsman.org.uk/sites/default/files/FDN-218144_Introduction_to_the_Social_and_Medical_Models_of_Disability.pdf">Ombudsman Introduction</a></h3>
    
      <p>In describing the social model, the Ombudsman distinguishes between 'impairement' which may have a basis in biological reality, and 'disability' which is viewed entirely within the Social Adapted model as due to lack of accomodation and non-inclusive societal structures. This feels a bit outdated for what my understanding of what the social model is now, but Ombudsman themselves is quick to offer that in practice, the medical and social model is more of a spectrum in its application.</p>
      <p>One point that Ombudsman clarifies, is that the medical model is useful in setting criterion that must be met in order for a person to be protected under legislation.</p>
      <p>It then provides a table of the two models in action. The 'social model' and 'medical model' provides solutions to various domains in life where Disabled people may experience barriers: solutions provided within the 'social model' are about integration of the Disabled people into mainstream settings as opposed to segregation, and creating accessible solutions for people and equivelant experiences. The medical model provides solutions that are segregated and highly specialized, and assume that the larger mainstream setting would not be appropriate. </p>

      <h3>Supplemental: <a href="https://www.yacvic.org.au/ydas/resources-and-training/together-2/values-and-ideas/two-models-of-disability/">Four models of disability by YDAS</a></h3>

      <p>The most accessible of the sources. This source contextualizes the shift from the medical model to the social model within deinstitutionalization. This is a good addition, but it gives the false impression that deinstitutionalization is a one-and-done issue. The institutions continue. Even hear about group homes?</p>

      <p>Another good addition that this source makes is saying that the charity model is derived from the fact that literal charities were once the only organizations capable of providing support, and that this system of organization "create[s] attitudinal barriers." It's a bit of a chicken and egg situation. Did the charity model emerge because of ableism, or did the charity model give birth to ableism?</p>

      <p>YDAS's presentation of the human rights model contrasts frome Ombudsman's presentation. Instead of focusing on development of quality of life through litigation, YDAS presents the human rights model similarly to how other sources talk about the biopsychosocial model and also integrates aspects of the minority/affirmation/identity model.</p>

      <h3>Supplemental: <a href="https://disabilityinpublichealth.org/1-1/">Disability in Public Health, Compare and Contrast Models</a></h3>
      <p>So this website's main menu is an h3 made clickable with Javascript but with no tabindex, so I can't actually tab to it. Fun. The main content that we're supposed to access is accessible, but the decorative image of text doesn't have alt text set to null so it can be ambiguous whether a person is missing out on information or not.</p>

      <p>The most interesting tidbit this source offers is in contrasting a 'functional model' and 'medical model' where I think many sources would merge the 'functional model' as presented here into the 'medical model' itself.</p>
      <p>The key distinction here is that the medical model focuses on biology and diagnosis, where the functional model is focused on symptoms and limits on functional activities. Another is distinction is made where (supposedly) the medical model sees Disability as a 'disruption' where the functional model sees it as a 'limitation.' I view this as a minimal semantic difference, but I suppose the authors are trying to emphasize that the functional model offers more room for a person to grow, where the medical model sees disability as a life sentence.</p>

      <h3>Supplemental: <a href="https://www.disabilityaustraliahub.com.au/disability/">Disability Australia Hub</a></h3>

      <p>Short and sweet resource, points out that the medical model of disability is highly specified to the individual. If someone's Disabled, that is a 'problem' only for them. Disability isn't viewed as a shaping force that needs to be reckoned with and accounted for in the way we structure our communities and relationships. It's just a problem.</p>

      <h2 id="note-48">CPACC Study Day 2/18: Disability Types</h2>
      <p>Noted Thursday, November 14, 2024</p>
  
      <p>Starting off today by giving my website's CSS a facelift. Oof. The redesign's colours do NOT look good, but at least the dark mode is way more respectable than before. I've used a bunch of 'variables' to manage colour, and organized the actual layout of the CSS document better. I still need to rework the reflow, but it's a good start.</p>
      <p>Now that I've wasted an hour and fifteen minutes on that, time to get into Anki memorization.</p>

      <h3>Anki Deck: Categories of Disabilities</h3>
      <p>Six types of cognitive disabilites: intellectual, reading, math, attention deficit hyperactivity, autism, non-verbal learning. Mnemonic: MARINA: math, ADHD, reading, intellectual, non-verbal learning, autism.</p>
      <p>Intellectual disabilies defined by IQ score (lower than 70-75), before the age of 18 + limitations, 1-3% of population, delayed development and slower cognitive function.</p>
      <p>Reading/dyslexia: reading ability low despite having normal intelligence; additionall difficulty with phonological processing, spelling, rapid visual-verbal responding. Causes vary wildly from the neurologic to the physical to injury. 'Dyslexia' diagnosis not applicable in all cases.</p>

      <h3>Interlude: More Blog Maintenance</h3>
      <p>I couldn't just leave the reflow bad and the colours ugly. I've fixed both, fixed the colour contrast. I just need to tackle hover and focus styles again, rework the 'Bookmarks' page, and then I'll be pretty satisfied.</p>

      <h3>Slight Change of Pace</h3>
      <p>I'm going to just read the entire Body of Knowledge today front to back to get a bird's-eye view of the situation here. This will also make the Anki deck studying more logical. </p>

      <p>Okay, I just finished up. That's a lot of content. I am 100% going to struggle the most with Domain 3. That's a lot of memorization and specific details to remember. I am newly worried about the extent to which additional reading will play a part in this. I am a bit upset that this document is only available as a PDF.</p>

      <p>In terms of a plan, it makes sense to me that I just need to set nose to grindstone. I'm going to take a small peak at Amy's work just to see the amount of time she dedicated to each section. The Body of Knowledge claims that Domain 3 consists of 20% of the exam. That's wild. It really does feel like it holds the most factual tidbits one has to memorize. Amy spent 2-3 hours a day over 45 days. If I do this for longer than that, I should be okay.</p>

      <h3>Anki Deck (continued)</h3>
      <p>Computation/Math disabilities include dyscalculia (inability to understand arithmetic or grasp the scope of numbers and logic) which 3-6% of people have and is has no set cause; it can be due to congenital, injury, aging, disease.</p>
      <p>ADHD's key symptoms are inattention, distractibility, impulsivity, and hyperactivity, affecting 11% of the population.</p>
      <p>ASD spectrum characterized by impaired social behaviour, communication, language. This definition wants us to focus on special interests, sensory issues, and echolalia alongside stunted development in early years, co-existing conditions, intellectual functioning is variable.</p>
      <p>Non-verbal learning disability is not in the DSM but is described as a condition similar to autism level one, with learning disability stemming from visuo-spatial processing limitations. <em>My commentary: It doesn't have consistent diagnostic criteria even in 2024, so I find it slightly suspect that IAAP puts it here.</em></p>

      <h2 id="note-47">CPACC Study Day 1/18: Disability Types</h2>
      <p>Noted Tuesday, November 12, 2024</p>

      <h3>Anki Deck: Categories of Disabilities</h3>
      <p>For types of disability, I've developed a mnemonic that goes with the song 'Head, Shoulders, Knees and Toes.' It goes, "Psychological, Compound, Mobility, Seizure, Mobility, Seizure, Mobility, Seizure. Cognitive, Compound, Mobility, Seizure; Visual, Auditory, Speech, Deaf-Blind." I do the actions as I say this.</p>
      <p><em>Side Note: People in my region sing "Head and Shoulders" to the tune of "London Bridge." In my opinion, this is the only way it should be done.</em></p>
      <h4>Vision</h4>
      <p>Blindness can refer to: partial blindness, low vision (can perceive light and dark and general shapes of large objects).</p>
      <p>Colour-blindness especially applies to colours that are of equal luminosity.</p>
      <p>Low-vision is a spectrum that is typically defined functionally.</p>
      <p>Visual disabilities comprise of the three above.</p>
      <h4>Auditory</h4>
      <p>Auditory disabilities are caused by genetics, prematurity, infections, ear trauma, exposure to loud noises, aging: auditory processing disorder, deafness, HOH.</p>
      <p>Deafness: 'total or near-total loss of hearing.' Some sign, some do not.</p>
      <p>HOH: 6.1% of population/466 million people, mild to severe hearing loss. Adequate assistance may be provided by AT.</p>
      <p>Central APD: 5% of global population, confused with other disorders, no hearing loss exists but difficulty understanding speech. Source of sound, distinguishing words, learning instruments, paying attention, learning new languages, responding in a timely way.</p>
      <p>Deafblindness: Prescence of deafness and blindness, leaving touch as the primary communication medium. 0.2-2% of people are DeafBlind. <strong>My commentary: there are a lot of peope who identify as DeafBlind who don't meet these descriptions. Blindness and Deafness have spectrums from Blind to low vision, Deaf to HoH. DeafBlind people can sit anywhere along those two axioms, and with that definition, I assume the prevalence listed would be higher.</strong></p>
      <h4>Speech Disabilities</h4>
      <p>There are eight types: stuttering, cluttering, apraxia, dysarthia, speech sound disorders, articulation, aphasia, and muteness (no speech). Our mnemonic will be 'Amass A CDs': aphasia, muteness, articulation, speech-sound, cluttering, apraxia, dysarthia, stuttering. Picture someone collecting a bunch of CDs only from artists whose names start with the letter A.</p> 
      <p>Articulation can be broken into three categories: speech sound, phonological process, and motor speech disorders. Characterized by adding/leaving off sounds, distorting or swapping sounds.</p>
      <p>Aphasia can affect comprehension of speech and reading/writing ability in addition to just produced speech. It results from brain injury (often a stroke), there are at least 2 million people in the US with it, and at least 250 thousand in Great Britain with it.</p>
      <p>Muteness is either neurogenic (aphasia, apraxia, disarthia) or psychogenic. Psychogenic mutism has three types: selective elective, selective non-elective, and total. 0.47-0.76 of the population has selective mutism.</p>
      <h4>Mobility, Flexibility, Body Structure</h4>
      <p>People with upper/lowe limb loss/disability, manual dexterity, difficulty cooordinating different organs of the body, and broken skeletal structure.</p>
      <p>Four subareas are manual dexterity, ambulation, muscle fatigue and body size/shape.</p>
      <p>Manual dexterity/fine motor control, requires coordination between the brain and muscles. Disability in this area can lead to handwriting issues and inability to dress independently. Can be hard to manipulate objects/use both hands at the same time. Children with ADHD have issues with this.</p>
      <p>Ambulation is the ability toe walk with or without an assistive device. Ambulation disabilities can be disease based or injury based: think cerebral palsy and back injuries. 3.5% of adults in the US have ambulatory disabilities.</p>
      <p>Muscle fatigue is associated with a bunch of causes and conditions and it's when basic tasks become very difficult. It can be in a specific part of the body and can present as soreness, twitching, trembling, cramping, and is associated with general weakness.</p>
      <p>Body size or shape disabilities affect stature, proportions or shape. Dwarfism, acromegaly, rheumatoid arthritis are some examples. This is characterized by the prescence of other co-occuring conditions.<strong> My comment: not surprising that it falls into line in presenting 'obesity' itself as a disease. As scholars of fat studies note, this is an argument with no evidence, and the prevelance of it leads to lesser health outcomes for obese patients due to misdiagnosis and mistreatment in medical settings. So I'm not surprised to see this here, and I'm not happy about it.</strong> </p>
      <h3>Palette Cleanser: Adrian Roselli on Tables</h3>
      <p>Roselli spoke about HTML tables at WebAIM, watch along with me at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaIjHF7FHv8">Talkin' Tables</a></p>
      <p>He clarifies that a caption is not a WCAG requirement, which is something I also came across recently. Scope isn't needed for simple tables (though I've come across the situation where you should add it if it is ambiguous what data is applicable to each header.) Also, your table headers must be in the first column in the DOM regardless of CSS presentation. Don't be putting them at the bottom of the table, or switching to new headers mid-table. Scope is not as important (the browser is good at figuring that out) as colspan and rowspan, theoretically. In practice, support for colgroup and rowgroup is low and incredibly variable across screen reader/browser combinations. Avoid spanning. Cell count can be affected by this, and inconsistant cell count can break navigation. Test, test, test!</p>
      <p>He talks about an over-enginnered and under-engineered pattern for making good table reflow. He says that he still 'feels bad' for relying on CSS-gennerated content. This is the pattern that Deque suggests so.. I'm curious as what Roselli thinks about that pattern now.</p>
      <p>I prefer the signing style of the second interpreter to the first one.</p>
      <p>Next we have fixed headers, both row and column. I have a hard time understanding him because I don't know what Z indexes are.</p>
      <p>Scroll snapping, Roselli rejects, citing usability concerns.</p>

      <p>Starting my morning off with Manuel MatuzoviÄ‡'s talk, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wno1IhEBTxc">Lost in Translation</a>.</p>

      <h3>Biting the Bullet</h3>
      <p>I've had a bit of hesitency around trying to get the CPACC certification. IAAP, the organization that backs this certification, maintains relationships with overlay shillers. The actual body of knowledge is far removed from conversations around disability justice. I don't get the impression that the IAAP truly operates under the axiom of 'nothing about us without us.' But with all that said, it's time to bite the bullet.</p>
      <p>I feel like I will gain no traction if I do not get this now.</p>
      <p>I am fortunate that I have the financial resources to pay the exorbitant exam fee.</p>

      <h3>Those Who've Tread Before</h3>
      <h4>1. <a href="https://dev.to/josefine/studying-for-cpacc-becoming-a-certified-accessibility-professional-2mh3">Josefine Schfr: Studying for CPACC | Becoming a Certified Accessibility Professional</a></h4>
      <p>What resonates for me here is that Schfr really didn't have a strong impression of how they did when they left the exam center, and it took six weeks for the results to arrive.</p>
      <p>Schfr links a few resources: the linked video by Derek Mei is what I'll be looking at next.</p>
      <h4>2. Reddit Threads</h4>
      <p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/accessibility/comments/1cwb4gj/iaap_cpacc_may_2024/">May 2024, u/Krysulia</a> posted this congregation thread of people anxiously waiting for the six-month period to let up.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/accessibility/comments/18j5ljt/passed_the_cpacc_exam_with_752/">Passed the CPACC with 752, u/TellAdministrative95</a>. This thread suggests working through all the material, then registering, and working through all the material again. This person preferred the Princeton course over Deque, but noted that some aspects were only covered in the Deque University course.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/accessibility/comments/16ftdvi/cpacc_level_of_study_required/?chainedPosts=t3_1da4fpn">CPACC: Level of Study Required? by u/ivytranfcd</a>. They provided some updates. They say the Deque course offered 'peace of mind' but didn't actually add much more material. One comment on this thread suggested using the Book of Knowledge and diving into 'further reading' as much as possible.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/accessibility/comments/11s3vj3/iaap_cpacc_exam_just_finished/?chainedPosts=t3_16ftdvi%2Ct3_1da4fpn">IAAP CPACC exam- just finished, by u/Necessary_Marzipan99</a>. This person was uh WILD and literally had TWO WEEKs to prepare. They say to focus on learning disabilities that start with d, universal design principles 2.0, and Japanese law. They were absolutely floored by the wait time for the results. Another commentor chimed in that they really felt that given that the IAAP doesn't actually assess whether a person can be a good accessibility practitioner, the fact that it is so unfriendly to neurodivergent folks is quite insidious.</p>
      <h4>3. <a href="https://youtu.be/a01vcZMTJqU">Full CPACC Study Guide by Derek Mai</a></h4>
      <p>Mai affirms that the IAAP's suggestion of 8 weeks of studying for the exam, with 5-10 hours per week was accurate.</p>

      <h3>My Strategy</h3>
      <h4>When</h4>
      <p>I have a choice to make. I can either do an exam sometime between November 13 (tomorrow!) to December 4, or I need to wait until January 22 to February 19.</p>
      <p>Now. I am very good at cramming. But December 4 is a bit much. February 19 is a bit mucher. It might be worth to just go for December 4, and then take again on February if I don't pass the first round. But simulatenously, I would rather be more confident than less confident. I can still do work in between studying for the exam, and I can still make my way through the Deque WAS courses, as I've been doing. There's no need to freak out. February will be here before I know it, and I'll have the results on April 2, 2025.</p>
      <p>That is a bit far off, however. Potentially I can also register for the Web Accessibility auditing credential at the <a href="https://continuing.torontomu.ca/search/publicCourseSearchDetails.do?method=load&courseId=26089061#courseProfileSections">Chang School at TMU</a> when the next section opens up.</p>
      <p>It appears that I've made the decision to take this on at the most inopportune time, in terms of timeline.</p>
      <h4>How</h4>
      <p>I have time so I guess we're just gonna memorize anything and everything.</p>
      <p>Also, I'm neurodivergent and my learning style trends towards the non-linear.</p>

      <h2 id="note-45">Web Almanac on Accessibility 2024</h2>
      <p>Noted Monday, November 11, 2024</p>
      <p>Opened Slack this morning to see that the 2024 edition of the Web Almanac's entry on accessibility is live! Read it at <a href="https://almanac.httparchive.org/en/2024/accessibility">Accessibility, Web Almanac 2024</a>.</p>

      <p>They link to <a href="https://inclusive.microsoft.design/">Microsoft Inclusive Design Principles</a>. The title makes it seem like a knock-off version of the seven <a href="https://inclusivedesignprinciples.info/">Inclusive Design Principles</a>, but I suppose I'll take a small detour to read it on its own merits.</p>
      <h3>Microsoft Inclusive Design Principles</h3>
        <p>There are three principles: 'Recognize exclusion,' 'Learn from diversity,' and 'Solve for one, Extend to many.' Immediatly, I compare these to the original Inclusive Design Principles which include autonomy-centered principles like 'Give control' and 'Offer choice.' Microsoft's principles seemes like an issue-centered approach: identify the barriers and tackle them. The original principles are most focused on creating an experience that never leads to barriers in the first place. In this sense, the original principles seem more like design principles, where the Microsoft principles are more like remediation principles.</p>
        <p>Let's take a slightly deeper look. They elaborate the principles in a PDF. Interesting.</p>
        <p><a href="https://inclusive.microsoft.design/tools-and-activities/Inclusive101Guidebook.pdf">Microsoft Inclusive Design Principles 101</a> defines disability as exclusion "includ[ing] situational impairements, activity limiations, and restrictions on participation," and presents this definition as a decision agreed-upon by everyone. This is not the case, even CPACC people will tell you that there are multiple models of disability that are important in different situations. Well then, is this definition an appropriate definition for discussing accessibility in a web design context? I don't believe so. This sets us up for conversations where a temporarily abled Accesibility Practitioner tells a Disabled user experience consultant, 'You know, if our app stops loading correctly, it means that everyone's Disabled.' In treating the word 'Disabled' this way, as a synonym for 'Excluded' (why not just say that?), you're dismissing some very real economic realities and histories of eugenics, intersectionality and resistance that have, over generations, formed Disabled identities. You aren't acknowledging the role of <a href="https://robertkingett.com/posts/6617/">Access Trauma</a>.</p>
        <p>For example, there's a website with bad contrast. We have two individuals. </p>
        <p>One of them is out on a beach on a sunny day enjoying the tenth day of their 14-day all-exclusive couple's resort experience. And she can't see the text on the website. She claps twice and summons an attendant. "Yes, Miss?" She asks for a parasol. She is able to access the content. </p>
        <p>The second individual has low vision and is routinely locked out of spaces due to bad contrast issues. Seeing that he cannot see the content on this website (it's the eleventh website in the past three days), he simply move on. He's exhausted. It's not worth the effort.</p>
        <p>These experiences are not equivelant. And if you intend to seek out new perspectives and interact with Disabled people, you should know this and how to respect that Disabled person's boundaries, hesitencies and safety.</p>
        <p>I'm not impressed. I think I'm going to head back to the Almanac now.</p>
      <h3>Almanac Intro</h3>
      <p>We start with an update on national regulations coming into effect across the globe, and new data showing that automated accessibility testing results have improved. This continues the trends that we've been seeing year over year.</p>
      <h3>Aspects of Accessibility, Measured</h3>

      <dl>
        <dt>Plain language</dt>
        <dd>The almanac basically says that while readibility and understability is crucial, there is no way to measure this.</dd>
        <dt>Color contrast</dt>

      <p>Noted Saturday, November 9, 2024</p>
  
      <p>Learned today that my Bakery project will probably not actually have an opportunity to be released, but I'm not exactly sad about that. It still loooks amazing and I can add it to my portfolio.</p>

      <p>Today we're returning to the auditing project I have. Mostly working through it with a spreadsheet.</p>

      <p>Noted Thursday, November 7, 2024</p>
      <h3> The Bakery Project Continues</h3>
      <p>Yesterday on Weekend Wednesday, I spent a lot of time working on the HTML/CSS Flexbox-focused project and I finally got it to look pretty. I grabbed a set of really pretty fonts, and threw together a colour palette. I can confidently say that it looks pretty good right now, though the padding isn't consistant. I want to just quickly fix the padding and throw together the bare structure of a nav. I won't take more than an hour on this. I do have other higher priority things to work on, mostly my auditing case study and getting through Deque University courses.</p>
      <p>Ended up using a full hour, but I am getting more and more used to nested flexbox shenanigans. I also learned how to make a circle: fix a width and height into a square, and set border radius to 50%. It isn't responsive yet, and I'd like to do a couple more things to pretty the thing up. But it's a solid start.</p>
      <p>Tomorrow I want to design a nice background image to compliment the colour scheme to put in the nav. But that's for tomorrow. Now it's time for some coursework.</p>
      <h3>Images, SVG and Canvas</h3>
      <h4>HTML map element</h4>
      <p>I last ran away from this because I saw the map element and I got scared. But the principals with this foreign element follow the rest of the direction for alt text. Make sure everything has concise and meaningful alt text where appropriate. If the area elements of the maps, name according to link conventions. Don't use the alt text as a place to describe things. An accessible description or caption might be a better place for that.</p>
      <p>Deque also specifies that server-side maps should not be used if client-side maps are an option. It provides no rationale for this, and I'm not familiar with what a server-side map is, so this is kinda useless information.</p>

      <h2 id="note-42">Case Study Day!</h2>
      <p>Noted Tuesday, November 5, 2024</p>
  
      <p>I've all of a sudden fell into two projects. I'm auditing a site for my friend just to build my portfolio, and I'm also working on another website so that I can hone my skills with Flexbox before I get started on grid.</p>
      <h3>HTML/CSS Project Observations</h3>
      <p>I really don't know how to make things beautiful! I also need to keep better track on all the containers that set different widths. Flexbox makes responsive design pretty easy to manage, but this website has so many components and it's hard to update everything.</p>
      <p>I think installing a nice font is the first step to make it not look so bad. I've also been undecided on what overall vibe I want it to be.</p>
      <p>Was having trouble initially trying to overlay some text on a gallery of images, but I managed to figure it out by nesting the text in a div with absolute positioning. </p>
      <p>Finding a good text size is also hard.</p>
      <p>I've accidentally built this so that if I zoom in, it still looks about the same, but it looks broken when I zoom out. Hmmmmm.</p>
      <p>Ack it looks so ugly, it's a bit unmotivating to work on.</p>

      <h3>Auditing Observations</h3>
      <p>I just need to get a good workflow.</p>

      <p>It's now almost nine in the evening and I feel a little sleepy, but I think I'm going to push forward</p>

      <h2 id="note-41">Button and Deque University 12/15</h2>
      <p>Noted Monday, November 4, 2024</p>
  
      <p>I had a indulgently restful Sunday. It was so lazy that I'm not even sure if it was energizing.</p>
      <p>But what's a more energizing start to the day than another HTML element explainer by Heydon Pickering?</p>

      <h3><a href="https://heydonworks.com/article/the-button-element/">The button element, by Heydon</a></h3>
      <p>We start off with a history lesson. Progressive enhancement was the norm back in the days when JS was unreliable. Heydon uses the example of an image gallery where smaller thumbnail images led to full-size images. This could be accomplished either natively, or progressively degraded via Javascript.</p>
      <p>Nowadays, Heydon argues that the state of JS reliance is even worse. Anchor elements as buttons are more common than semantic buttons themselves.</p>
      <p>To finish, Heydon discusses four points to anyone who wants to make faux buttons:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Use aria roles and states</li>
        <li>Emulate all other button behaviours (like Space key activation)</li>
        <li>Provide feedback by changing aria states upon activation</li>
        <li>Consider why you're doing this in the first place</li>
      </ol>
      <p>Heydon actually ends up giving not a lot of information about the button element, but about people looking to emulate button behaviour with anchor classes (or god forbid, divs!) underappreciate how much amazingness is baked into the button already.</p>

      <h3>Images, SVG and Canvas</h3>
      <p>I have my Deque window resized and zoomed, and I'm noticing that their video player has a fixed width and isn't reflowing properly. Interesting.</p>
      <h4>Alt text</h4>
      <p>Just like most other elements, the hierarchy for accessible names goes aria-labelledby, aria-label, and then alt. title can also provide an accessible name, but behaviour varies wildly. I am reminded of Sara Soueidan's advice that title is only good for providing an accessible name to an iframe.</p>
      <p>We start off reviewing the basics. All images have an alt attribute, don't be too long, don't say 'image of' or 'picture of,' set the alt attribute to null if the image is decorative or the text is duplicative.</p>
      <p>Next, actionable images. As normal, provide control information on these. Deque brings up the unique case of a QR code. Though not programmatically actionable, one can physically activate it using a camera and pointing to it. So Deque suggests alt text that describes how to interact with it.</p>
      <p>For the form input type="image" you can use the alt attribute. I didn't even know about this.</p>
      <p>As for moving content, we have the five-second threshold for visual moving content, as well as 3 flashes for second for animated images, along with a link to the <a href="http://trace.umd.edu/peat">PEAT</a> checker tool for epilepsy.</p>

      <p>Interesting note for long descriptions for complex images: the accessible description should also be visible to sighted users, because everyone can benefit. This is a best practice.</p>

      <p>This is also important because according to <a href="https://adrianroselli.com/2022/04/accessible-description-exposure.html">Adrian's post on accessible description exposure</a>, the support for consistant accessible description is not there. Especially don't use it for dynamic descriptions. In this case with complex images, it benefits everyone if the description and image is located close to each other in the DOM structure. So even if the explicit programmatic association isn't made, at least it can be found intuitively.</p>
      <p>There are two ways to give alt text to a CSS background image: aria-label (not great because it doesn't translate) and the visually hidden clip method. Ideally though, avoid doing this.</p>

      <h4>Images of Text</h4>

      <p>No Images of Text! I have just today run into an artist's website. They have used images of their own handwriting in their entire nav, and I'm wondering if CSS text styling could possibly approximate that effect. I wonder if a custom font pack could be made and downloaded and used on the site. <a href="http://2ttf.com/">iFontMaker</a> might be able to do it. That does seem like quite a bit of effort, but it might be an interesting endeavor?</p>

      <h4>Image Maps</h4>

      <h2 id="note-40">Maybe it's Not the Weekend: Deque University 11/15</h2>
      <p>Noted Saturday, November 2, 2024</p>
  
      <p>I tend to be most productive when I'm at a fast food establishment at some time with my charger plugged in. Today I have a couple goals. I want to do Deque stuff, and then I want to maybe look at some old websites of mine and start revamping them for accessibility. That way, I can add them to a 'portfolio' of sorts.</p>
      <h3>Responsive Design</h3>
      <h4>Background</h4>
      <p>I see what Deque is trying to get at with the sentence, 'you could kind of say that <em>everyone</em> has low vision, when it comes to mobiles devices' but that kinda trivializes the experience of having low vision. I would phrase it as 'when it comes to mobile, everyone needs the assistive technology known as Zoom,' or something along those lines.</p>
      <p>Three kinds of Screen Magnification: zoom provided by the browser, zoom provided by the OS, and third-party zooming.</p>
      <h4>Breakpoints and Media Queries</h4>
      <p>Media queries in CSS is something I tried to do a couple days ago and it didn't go over very well. Right now, my site has a very simple, mobile-friendly layout. But I do want to test out new layouts with flexbox and grid soon, so these are useful techniques to learn.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Query for the following sizes: max-width 700px, max-width 1060px, and min-width 1061px. These media queries are for phone, tablet and large device respectively.</li>
        <li>Query for the following media types: 'speech' for screen readers, 'print' for printers, and 'embossed' for braille printers. I feel like some well-intentioning devs querying for speech can totally not account for sighted screen readers though, so use with caution.</li>
        <li>Other fancy media queries: query for orientation (landscape or portrait). Query for progressive or interlaced scanning. I didn't know what these are: but here's a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/vfzzod/eli5_what_is_the_difference_between_interlaced/">'Explain it like I'm Five' post on scanning types</a>. Query based on the aspect ratio of the viewport, based. Query if it's a text-based device like a TTY using 'grid,' query via resolution, and what colour capacity the device has. </li>
        <li>Make it even more specific by using logical operators. The <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@media#logical_operators">media query logical operators</a> are only for use in media queries.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Deque elaborates that the breakpoints they give won't work for every situation. But it gives a handy table that adds watches as a value: max-value 320px. They encourage you to use viewport emulators to check for reflow and zooming, but say that you shouldn't test basically anything else with this. I do sometimes find it is easier to find the bugs behind things if we test keyboard-style navigation while in an small device emulator.</p>

      <h4>Images and Objects Reflow</h4>
      
      <p>Vector images will magnify without using quality. Using them, over rasting types, is ideal.</p>
      <p>Use max-width: 100% on images to prevent horizontal scrolling on mobile. Another image hack is literally providing different versions of the picture for differently sized devices using 'srcset.'</p>
      <p>For objects and plugins, prevent horizontal overflow by setting it's container to max-width: 100%.</p>
      <h4>Responsive Tables</h4>
      <p>So it talks about how for complex tables, you actually need to translate the layout to a single-column table thing for proper reflow to take place. And it gives and example. Looking at the code, it does use the 'content' property. As expected of a content property, I cannot highlight some of the text with my mouse. But Orca reads it! What?!.</p>
      <p>I've asked the slack. I have no idea what is going on and it makes me feel very small.</p>

      <h4>Text Reflow</h4>
      <p>Okay. So my website is fine in terms of the breakpoints specified by Reflow. But it does break when I set it to watch dimensions. Right now, the max-width is set to a fixed value in the unit, 'ch.' I still want to keep that, but I want to try setting the main body to have a max-width of 100%. This seems to kinda repair it, but I do need to design a stylesheet that specifically gets rid of some of this padding in the case of a very, very small viewport.</p>
      <p>Deque also has some tips for linear text reflow: let the main content fill the width of the viewport, eliminate multiple columns, eliminate floating objects, eliminate panning, and eliminate minimum and fixed widths.</p>

      <h4>Simplification</h4>
      <p>In order to fit all UI components that need to be there, Deque suggests that content can be simplified and reduced. If it is nonessential content, it can even be eliminated upon reflow.</p>

      <h4>Zoom Text</h4>
      <p>I have come across this idea of text-only zoom before, but it's been a little while. <a href="https://ashleemboyer.com/blog/an-accessibility-bookmarklet-for-testing-200-percent-text-size">Ashlee M Boyer's Resize Text bookmarklet</a> might come in handy here, so I'm linking to it.</p>

      <h3>Winding Down</h3>
      <p>And that is a wrap on that module! Huzzah! I'm browsing a little bit for fun.</p>
      <p><a href="https://devonpersing.netlify.app/posts/survey2022part1/#why-is-accessibility-important-to-you%3F">Accessibility roles demographics by Devon Persing</a> surveys accessibility professionals and asks basic questions about who they are and how they feel about their work.</p>

Good to see that Amy is still thinking about a11y. She's the one that pilotted 100 days of A11y, the site that partially inspired this learning journal.</p>

      <p>We're a month and a half into this journey. I've learned a lot more HTML and CSS than I initially planned on learning, but I still feel like I know very, very little. I do think I need to re-evaluate and set some learning priorities for the next couple weeks. Set some goals.</p>

      <h2 id="note-38">Deque University 10/15</h2>
      <p>Noted Thursday, October 31, 2024</p>
      <p>Starting a new module: Device-Independent Input Methods. Gonna make it a light goal to get through the entirety of this today.</p>

      <h3>The Mouse</h3>
      <p>Discusses that target size should not be tiny. Doesn't describe what tiny is.</p> 
      <p>Discusses that on custom components, cursor behaviour should mimic behaviour on equivelant semantic elements. Not WCAG.</p>
      <p>Execute code when the person releases the pointer on the element, not when they press down on the element.</p>

      <h3>The Keyboard</h3>
      <p>Deque shows a custom span 'link' with tabindex set to zero and calls it a 'Good Example.' I mean, I wouldn't call that 'good'...</p>
      <p>Have a good focus order.</p>
      <p>Don't use positive tabindex values.</p>
      <p>It is mandatory that focus indicators are there. It is best practice to provide an enhanced focus style.</p>
      <p>It is best that focus indicators have some kind of outline, because background colour get smushed in WHCM.</p>
      <p>Deque shows you a pattern for a custom link with JS and ARIA and is like, 'don't get too excited about this!'</p>
      <p>Functionality must be available to keyboard-only users. No inaccessible tooltips, please.</p>
      <p>Don't keyboard trap please.</p>
      <p>Useful tip here. Deque says "For content added to the screen in reaction to a user-fired event, focus should be shifted to the new content." This would be applicable to my weird eraser widget. I didn't know you can use JS to set focus, but this could be another solution to my problem. It's not great though, because when I'm a keyboard-only user, I want to be able to just expand the menu and LOOK at it. Not necessarily to navigate all the way up there.</p>
      <p>Another nugget: When moving or setting focus, the destination element MUST contain programmatically determinable text. I didn't know this. Currently, my skip link for my table of contents goes to something that is like this. So maybe I need to change this. I can't change it to skip to the first note without using Javascript. I might be able to set it to visually hidden text. But that isn't a great solution.</p>
      <p>Am not super hyped as to how much Deque hypes up the ARIA APG.</p>
      <p>Genuinely kinda confused how people make instructions appear only when keyboard focus is received. I know you can put it to show up with the CSS :focus, but :focus will flash whenever a component is clicked on. At least, in Firefox.</p>
      <h3>Touch Input</h3>
      <p>Tapping is equivelant to clicking, so don't make something keyboard-only. Don't rely on drag and drop, and don't rely on gestures. Not all mobile devices support them, and not all users can perform them.</p>
      <p>A minimum width of 44px is good to ensure a minimum target size across web apps. On native apps, devices with 2x the pixel density need double the width. I wonder how one can query for this.</p>
      <p>They also show an instance of 'visual padding that is not part of the touch target.' They accomplish this by applying padding to an li, and not to the a that is the actual target. This makes it look like the touch target is quite big, but is only actually confined to the text.
      </p>
      <p>Deque identifies a couple of techniques that can mess with focus order for screen-reader users on mobile: .visually-hidden classes, aria-hidden="true", and onblur and onfocus. I am curious as to whether my aria-hidden hr separators fuck up TalkBack, so I'm going to test that now.</p>
      <p>It seems that my skip navigation link doesn't work on Talkback+Firefox, but it does work on Talkback+Chrome. In terms of aria-hidden, it seems to be ignoring that fine. I need to test with the iPad when I get back home.</p>
      <h3>Voice Control</h3>
      <p>Can someone use a screen-reader using Dragon Naturally Speaking? Nuance provides <a href="https://www.nuance.com/products/help/dragon15/dragon-for-pc/enx/dpg-cp/Content/Help/tips_for_vision_impaired_users.htm">Tips for vision-impaired users</a> claiming it is compatible with most popular screen readers, like JAWS. But it gives a bunch of extra tips just in case peopple have problems operating it. I've never thought about this combo before, but it makes sense that it exists. There are Blind people out there who have restricted mobility, or RSI. The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uVvWRM7WLQ">Vista Center for the Blind on YouTube</a> offers a video titled 'Dragon Naturally Speaking as a JAWS user. I will need to watch this when I get home.</p>
      <p>Interesting that Dragon actually does has some (limited) support for ARIA. I had read that there was zero ARIA support, so this is good to see. If this is the case, how in the world can a screenreader and Dragon work together? I have a hard time picturing how it all fits together.</p>
      <h3>Motion, Disappearing Content, and Transitions</h3>
      <p>Nice reminder about motion actuation and what that word means. It refers to motion that isn't a pointer gesture (like swiping) or just touching the screen. Rather, this is like shaking your phone to undo, or waving at the camera to get it it to click.</p>
      <p>Don't make interactive content move or disapear.</p>
      <p>For transitions, keep them to a minimum and make sure they aren't too slow. It can be quite bad for people with coMaybe You Donâ€™t Need a Date Picker (added 8 February 2024 because APG added a date picker some time ago and I missed it)gnitive disabilities.</p>
      <p>Deque says to reduce the use of parallax effects and to avoid them if you can, citing vestibular issues. What is a parallax effect?</p>
      <p>From <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_parallax.asp">'Parallax Scrolling' from W3Schools</a>, it looks like it refers to an animation effect triggered by scrolling that makes the page look like it has depth. I think this is a situation of 'you'll know it when you see it.'</p>

      <p>Module complete!</p>

      <h3>Interlude: A JS word counter</h3>
      <p>Okay I did not do a good job but it did give me what I wanted, roughly. This page now has about 20 thousand words worth of notes on it. Wow. That is not very much. Or maybe it is. I used to be a humanities major, my judgement is totally skewed.</p>

      <h3><a href="https://adrianroselli.com/">Adrian Roselli</a> Articles</h3>

      <p>I have some extra time as I sit around waiting for children to come trick-or-treating to my door.</p>

      <h4>1. <a href="https://adrianroselli.com/2016/12/be-wary-of-nesting-roles.html">Be Wary of Nesting Roles</a></h4>
      <p>The title kinda says it all. I didn't know that the interactive elements specifically couldn't be nested inside each other. I kinda figured people didn't do it, but I didn't know it was actually a rule.</p>
      <p>This really makes me reconsider all the times I've seen people say that they just put tabindex=0 on random things to make keyboard navigation easier. And that is not good! Because by using tabindex=0, you've made something into a interactive component! And now you have poor nesting!</p>
      <p>Additionally, ARIA roles like button and checkbox, etc, also make these things interactive. So you can definitely create some very nesty situations if you're not careful.</p>
      
      <h4>2. <a href="https://adrianroselli.com/2019/02/uncanny-a11y.html">Uncanny A11y</a></h4>
      <p>This article describes a set of accessibility interventions that actually end up making the product less accessible than it was initially. The best part of this article is Adrian telling stories about seeing these in the wild. Some of these stories are incredible.</p>
      <p>tabindex=0 on everything is our first culprit. Adrian has seen devs use it to 'provide keyboard navigation' on native tables. He also describes seeing some people intentionally use positive tabindex values to make the visual layout out of sync with the page order. Bone-chilling, psychopathic!</p>
      <p>Our second culprit is some class ARIAbuse, in the form of providing hints by aria-label. Adrian gives one incredible example of an accessibility overlay widget that overrides every single link on the page to give 'accesibility help instructions' via an arialabel.</p>
      <p>Weird alt text patterns is our third culprit. These are the classic offenders: overdescription, redundant 'image of' or 'picture of' or 'logo,' as well as AI-generated alt text. He also points weird punctuation things when images are used inline as a potential offender.</p>
      <p>Pronounciation overrides are our forth. Just go look at the examples he gives, pure comedic gold!</p>
      <p>Alack, aria-roledescription, I knew you would show up! Our fifth offender! Using aria-roledescription to provide hints is against the whole use of that spec in the first place.</p>
      <p>Our fifth is siblings with our sixth offender: Providing unneccesary control instructions. This time, not just restricted to aria-roledescription. Using aria-label will violate 2.5.3. Even if you use a visually hidden class, you cannot write control instructions if you do not know the device.

      <p>The ARIA APG is our sixth offender. Adrian says that he finds himself 'standing in front of rooms of 30 developers at a time on a twice-monthly basis having these conversations' about how the APG are not a standard, and aren't robust, and do not guarantee accessibility.</p>

    <h3>Some Reflections</h3>
    <p>Today I'm thinking a lot about productivity and how to keep this whole endeavor sustainable, especially in these beginning months where my earnings are going to be slim to nil. In <a href="https://youtu.be/ALaTm6VzTBw">Weekend Wednesday (Youtube)</a>, CGP Grey makes the argument that taking a small break in the middle of the week, and then working through Saturday, is a way energy and persistance can be life-hacked to last longer. Today I might have done just that.</p>
    <p>I watched a bunch of talks from CSS Day in Amsterdam that I understood only portions of. I napped. I did some bed-rotting. I did some free code camp stuff. It did feel very relaxed and nice.</p>
    <p>I am slightly worried that every day is starting to feel like this. I need to rethink my timeline and strategy.</p>

    <p>I just spent a few minutes giving my notes post-it colours and complimentary hover/focus styles. It is a weekend indeed!</p>

    <h3>Typography</h3>
    <p>These are all based on Level AAA, so they won't be super applicable for auditing. Deque suggests a line height of at least 1.5 for paragraphs. So I changed it in my blog. I do think it improved readability somewhat.</p>

    <h3>CSS-Generated Content</h3>
    <p>Deque does address the CSS content thing, and says to use it sparingly. They recommend to set it to aria-hidden: true if it's decorative. I don't know how to do this on my hr so that it preserves the separator, but gets rid of saying all the pencils outloud.</p>
      
    <h3>Distraction: Videos</h3>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/ob_M_qXeDVE">Accessibility and CSS by Sara Soueidan (YouTube)</a> is very refreshing to watch. She brings up really good points about the content attribute, and also about interactive elements styled to be visually hidden. Also criticizes 'hacks' that lead to Label in Name violations. Soueidan states that aria-label will often not get translated while aria-labelledby will get translated. I thought I had read somewhere that support for aria-label was actually getting there. Also a REALLY great tip about the use of list-style none that I hadn't seen before. Lots of gems in this video.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/EOiC2M47GBY">Accessibility and CSS by Manuel Matuzovic (YouTube)</a> is an older video with a similar scope. Has a lot to say about CSS grids which seem to have been a recent release 6 years ago. Brings up a really fascinating keyboard focus behaviour when grids contain things of varying heights. Slightly more beginner friendly, which meant a lot of content here wasn't new to me.</p>

    <h3>Hidden Content</h3>
    <p>Couple nuggets here that befit typing down here for memorization purposes.</p>
    <p>When content is activated on hover, there must be a way to dis miss the content without moving the pointer away.</p>
    <p>Double check that all hidden components </p>
    <p>I'm a bit baffled by the next one. I'll post it in full for commentary purposes:</p>
    <blockquote>
      Visually hidden and inactive content MUST be hidden from screen reader users until that content is made visible and active for sighted users.
    </blockquote>
    <p>This is under "Visual Design and Colors (with WCAG 2.2 updates)" by Deque University. Uh. Doesn't the wording of this completely make supplying any content directed at screen-reader users completely illegal? What are they saying here?<p>
    <p>Deque's use of the word 'must' indicates that this is required to be compliant with WCAG 2.2 Level AA. This just feels wrong. It would be so nice if Deque cited what SC were at play as they walked through the course.</p>
    <p>Maybe I'm just misunderstanding English. This is my interpretation of that statement. If content is hidden visually, it must also be hidden from the screen reader user. Therefore, content cannot be hidden to sighted users and exposed to screen reader users. The .visually-hidden class is engineered to hide content from sighted users and expose it to screen reader users. Therefore visually-hidden breaks WCAG.</p>

    <p>There is a third posibility, which is that this restricts .visually-hidden to only replicate content that would otherwise be available to a sighted user. However, we get into a ship of Theseus situation. It is duplicate content, but it is not the same content.</p>
    <p>I can't find anything about this in the WCAG. I might be looking wrong. It feels shitty. I might have to go ask the slack.</p>
    <p>Okay, I made a post in the slack. Let's soldier on in the meantime, and revisit later.</p>
  

    <h3>Interlude: FreeCodeCamp</h3>

    <p>FreeCodeCamp doesn't teach accessibility correctly. Here's an excerpt from their module on 'accessibility.'</p>
    <blockquote>
    To increase the page accessibility, the role attribute can be used to indicate the purpose behind an element on the page to assistive technologies. The role attribute is a part of the Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI), and accepts preset values.

    Give each of the section elements the region role.
    </blockquote>
    <p>You don't need these landmarks. Also, it's totally redundant. Section already has a built in region role.</p>
    <p>It proceeds to tell you that sans serif is more accessible. That isn't WCAG. Yes, it's easier to read. But it's still not WCAG. It's also more important that the font size is larger. Grr.</p>

    <p>I can definitely design my eraser button to be better. Also it doesn't make sense that the eraser button does the opposite of erase content. It adds content. So maybe I should rethink the functionality of it entirely. I think I actually need it to be a toggle with aria pressed. But today we're doing more Deque.</p>

    <h3>Colour Contrast</h3>
    <p>For mobile applications, Deque suggests a contrast of 7 to 1. This reminds me that I neeed to fix how my site displays on mobile. Graphics needed to understand content need a contrast of 3 to 1.</p>
    <p>The contrast of all visual focus indicators against the background must be at least 3 to 1. I actually don't know if my blog has this sufficiently. The default focus style is probably fine, but I've customized the focus style on some components and it might not be enough. My website's dark mode is atrocious.</p>
    <p>Okay, I didn't know about the size requirement for the WCAG 2.2 focus indicators. My eraser button one hundred percent fails. It also does not have good contrast ratio between the same pixels in the focused and unfocused states. I need to restyle that. I actually need to re-do pretty much every aspect of that whole button.</p>
    <p>Another component that fails this focus indicator is the focus indicator for page=current. I am actually going to try to fix that now. </p>
    <p>I already use the outline attribute by default, so I simply made the outline bigger on hover alongside the red underscore. I think this counts as visible because the background contrast between the outline and the background colour of the document is greater than 3 to 1.</p>
    <p>Reading about the minimum contrast on UI components made me hunker down and change my eraser's styling. I still can't seem to get rid of a faint blue outline that comes in. I think I need to manually remove the user agent default in order for that to happen.</p>
    <p>Okay interesting. The size rule is actually a Level AAA criterion, not Level AA. Hence why this seemed totally whiplashy. Good to know. </p>

    <p>I wonder if there is an equivelant to WHCM for Linux? Google doesn't give me the answer, but I stumbled into this talk by <a href="https://youtu.be/CJltSqksCn0">Eric Bailey on WHCM</a>.</p>

    <h2 id="note-34">CSS Tricks 1/1</h2>
    <p>Noted October 27, 2024</p>

    <p>It's a Sunday and I feel like learning some even more CSS, so I'm pulling up <a href="https://css-tricks.com">CSS Tricks</a> and seeing if there's anything easy here that I can just look at.</p>

    <h3><a href="https://css-tricks.com/books/greatest-css-tricks/scroll-animation/">Scroll Animation</a></h3>
    <p>This trick starts with Javascript. First, we get a percentage of how much the user has scrolled down. We get this by grabbing the integer for how much the user has scrolled (window.pageYOffset) and then dividing that by the height of the document minus the height of the window. We then assign this value to a CSS variable --scroll, and we get this function to run everytime the user scrolls by simply adding an event listener 'scroll' to the document and nesting this whole thingy as an arrow function within that event listener call.</p>
    <p>That was a lot to start off with! Here's what I learned from dissecting that:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The 'scroll' eventListener exists.</li>
      <li>We can make CSS variables through document.body.setyle.setProperty()</li>
      <li>We can add event listeners to the window. Also the window is a thing. I think I only ever saw document when I was learning elementary javascript back in the day.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Let us move on to using this to value to do something. First, the author describes a simple animation that makes something spin infinitely in a 360deg rotation. I have never seen CSS animations before, let's look at <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_animations.asp">CSS animation in W3C schools</a>.</p>
    <p>We use @keyframes as a way to create code for an animation and we can control this by settting states of the animation at different percents of animation completion, or by the key words 'to' and 'from.' We name the animation and assign it to an element via animation-name, where we can also set the animation-duration, and animation-delay, iteration count, direction, and fill mode, amongst other things.</p>
    <p>Back to our scrolling animation. CSS tricks uses the animation shorthand property to make the keyframes animation called 'rotate' (which transforms to 360deg rotation upon completion of the animation) last one second, have linear timing function, and persist infinitely. This is the default state of the animation.</p> 
    <p>We incorporate the scrolling by pausing the animation using animation-play-state, and dynamically calculating the animation delay by grabbing the percent we had before and setting it into calc(), and fill-mode is set to both.</p>
    <p>To make the animation robust, iteration-count is set to 1.</p>
    <p>Let's pause here and reflect. What did we learn?</p>
    <ul>
      <li>@keyframes is a totally new concept for me. It almost looks like all the text in the keyframes is a totally new programming language.</li>
      <li>Animations in CSS are complicated and can be controlled in so many ways. But the end result is beautiful. Sometimes they might behave weirdly, so defining them as robustly as we can is a good idea.</li>
      <li>We can use calc() to dynamically set values in CSS without using javascript. Wild. Unless that's embedded Javascript. No, I don't think so. I think this is just modern CSS! How pretty!</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Interlude: Notes Structure</h3>
    <p>On this blog, Notes holds by far the bulk of the content. Right now, it's all hosted on one singular page. I like this for my own usability. I can very easily Ctrl+F search to find resources that I might have consulted in the past. But the page is starting to get a bit bloated, and I might want to offer alternative ways to interact with this page. Soon, my table of contents will be so big that it can't fit into the normal viewport. Javascript might be a solution to this. Maybe I could have it so that all entries are visible by default, but if Javascript is enabled, it will only display the first ten entries or so. Maybe twenty. And then it will load a button that will basically be like, show full table of contents, and then you can expand it that way. Maybe I'll work on that now. </p>

    <p>So at the first pass, I've accomplished what I wanted to do. Now, to make it accessible. Interaction with aria-expanded is kinda weird. I also want to make it accessible to how I use the site, when I'm only using the keyboard. I think </p>
    <p>So, the current result is definitely a work in progress. I got the thing to look a little bit like an eraser. But currently, the whole script depends on the new button and link being children to a ul element, which is not great semantically. So I will need to rewrite this by appending this all in the right places. But not now. Right now I want to get back to CSS tricks.</p>

    <p>Here's my vision: a bunch of pencils on my website. Every place where there currently is an 'hr' tag. Which means I need to probably mess with the CSS of my hr tag. But I don't think this can be done with only that. This might require some additional work.</p>

    <p>I have no idea if I did it right. I just injected pencils emojis into my hr tag via css 'content' and I feel like that should be illegal. But I like it, and I'm the primary audience of this blog, so they're here for now.</p>

    <p>I've randomly styled my table of contents to look like a sheet of looseleaf. It isn't pretty or anything. I need a solution that uses more divs and flex whatever, but what I've come up with is pretty funny. And it looks kind of cute.</p>
    <p>I learned about :before and :after for when you want to insert content. I also learned that :visited is pretty restricted. It's a shame. I wanted to insert little checkmarks after the visited links but I suppose it wasn't meant to be. I could do Javascript. Meh.</p>

    <h3>Articles from <a href="https://janmaarten.com/">Jan Maarten</a></h3>
    <h4>1. <a href="https://janmaarten.com/gaad-2023/">Socks, lies, and accessibility</a></h4>
    <p>Maarten demonstrates that accessiWasp shilling was occuring on multiple sock puppet accounts, posing to be legitimate businesses while actually being "referral sites." That is, not real. They had accounts on a bunch of platforms and even had phone numbers listed. Registered phone numbers. It's totally conspiracy-level material that Jan Maarten has found here.</p>
    <p>These accounts all promoted the same boilerplate template in the name of Global Accessibility Awareness Day 2023. </p>

    <h4>2. <a href="https://janmaarten.com/ghost-bookmark-accessibility/">Fixing keyboard focus on Ghost bookmark cards</a></h4>
    <p>Maarten describes that instead of Medium or Wordpress, they currently use Ghost to post content. Now, I don't really know how most people make websites. I have always just done everything in HTML from the bottom up and used external hosting. But here, Maarten provides a Javascript workaround for weird hyperlink placement within the hosting tool that Maarten uses.</p>
    <p>It is kinda a relief sometimes to look at a piece of code and understand what it is it is doing. Maarten comments that the solution might not be valid on paginated blogs.</p>

    <h4>3. <a href="https://janmaarten.com/cpacc/">Moving Beyond the Bare Minimum</a></h4>
    <p>In light of being recently certified as a CPACC, Maarten mourns that these basic skills are not more pervasive amongst the Designing and Developer population.</p>
    <p>I read Maarten's comments. I've touched on the CPACC a couple times in this blog, but my thoughts on it are quite complex. What does it mean to isolate accessibility expertise and to funnel it into people like me, who don't know crap about design and development? It is like making a leg operate separate of its body, is it not?</p>
    <p>Here's a question I should pose myself: If there was a button that would make all Design and Dev people instantly WCAG-proficient throughout the entire world, how sad would I be when I pushed it?</p>
    <p>This prospect of being an accessibility professional has brought such direction to my life. But it's been a rather self-serving endeavor. It has to be. That's what it means to embark on something as a career. Scary thoughts.</p>

    <p>Be the squeaky wheel, is the first advice offered. I read this as 'Take up space.' I'm not good at that. I need to get better at that.</p>
    <p>Celebrate attempts, as well as wins, is the second piece of advice. This makes sense. People love positive reinforcement. I would assume this is hard advice to give to people who experience ongoing access trauma.</p>
    <p>Steven concludes saying 'when all else fails, do it anyway.' I read from this, 'learn to do it yourself.' Right not, I don't often do it myself because I simply don't know how. I need to learn all of the things!</p>
    <p>I also appreciate Woodson's honestly about imposter syndrome in this article.</p>

    <h2 id="note-30">Reflections on My First Meeting Ever</h2>
    <p>Noted October 24, 2024</p>
    <p>I learned a couple things.</p>
    <h3>Competition</h3>
    <p> First, I learned that there may be more competition in this field than I anticipated. It's hard to believe. I can't find anything about people doing this kind of work on LinkedIn, so maybe the people I'm talking to are talking to people from Ontario or something. The most impactful moment in the meeting was when I said that I was able to deliver a product that a competitor might charge double or triple the amount of money for. I wasn't sure if that was the right thing to say, but it got their attention. In truth, I don't know what other people charge. They might be out here charging $100/hour. They might be charging $20/hour. It's hard to make statements about being cheaper than competitors if I literally have no basis from which to judge that metric.</p>
    <h3>Disposition</h3>
    <p>Secondly, I need to work on my professional persona. I come across as naive, young, and inexperienced. I need to come across like I know my stuff, and I didn't do that as much. I can maybe still preserve a slight dash of youthful innocence, but I need to sound more like I can get the job done. The odds are already stacked against me in terms of my positionality. God, sometimes I really do wish that I was just a straight white man with facial hair and a big ego.</p>
    <h3>Orientation</h3>
    <p>I needed this meeting to be a pitch meeting. But I didn't know that until I was midway through the meeting. I needed a pitch, and I didn't have one fully formed. I will be better prepared next time. It sucks, but I do need to take on the attitude of a salesman. I thought that talking about DEI and strategy would be enough. That was a naive assumption.</p>
    <h3>A Coincidence</h3>
    <p>The first job interview I ever did in my entire life, I was interviewed by my childhood bully who used to beat me up in first grade. The position was for a day camp counsellor.</p>
    <p>Yesterday, I learned that the people responsible for this potential client's website are the same people that were in charge of the other website I audited one year ago, the first website I ever audited, and the thing that lead me into the field in the first place.</p>
    <p>Somehow, these two coincidences feel very similar.</p>
    <h3>Self-Esteem</h3>
    <p>My self-esteem was absolutely crushed after this meeting. It was bad. I need to be able to bounce back faster from failures. Failure is a win condition. I need to be able to tolerate failure!</p>

    <h3>So What Exactly is Button?</h3>
    <p>Buttons should be distinguishable from text, Deque says. But the example they give is four icons that have text to them. Two of these icons are a gear icon with the text 'Settings' and a envelope with the text 'Contact Us.' These look like links to me. But maybe some links are buttons. I am rather confused.</p>
    <p>I would have thought that a button uses the button html element. Or a div or link using aria roles. But crucially, it activates a change of state on the page, right? Let's research.</p>

    <p><a href="https://a11y-101.com/design/button-vs-link">A11Y-101's article 'Button vs Link'</a> is basically what I described and conforms to my expectations. They elaborate that some CSS frameworks can steer developers into conflating the two of them and make the argument that buttons and links should be visually distinct.</p>

    <p><a href="https://yatil.net/blog/buttons-vs-links">Eric Eggert's article on Buttons vs Links</a> has the headline: No, they are not the same. He notes a couple of cool behaviours. For example, buttons can be activated with a space, links cannot. Buttons don't come up on screenreaders when they fetch a list of all links. Buttons use a normal mouse pointer on hover, use a pointing hand mouse on hover. In terms of styling, Eric recommends some kind of visual distinction, but he isn't as particular. Descriptive text for functionality is more important for users to understand where they are going.</p>

    <p>Stepping back for a moment, I suppose my concern stems from Deque using 'button' to refer to something that really does look like a link. It might just be an oversight. But I think if it is, it's revealing a commonly tolerated inprecision in language that probably perpetuates devs using the wrong element, because in common speech, the two are interchangeable. I suppose I'm being influenced by Adrian Roselli's super strict view on language precision in naming patterns and components. I'm sure there are more urgent cases that require addressing, but we can maybe put this on the waiting list.</p>

      Scoping Table Headers
    </h3>
    <p>It is not enough to simply designate some row or col through table headers. You also have to establish which data that row or col is associated with using the parameter of 'scope.' All data also needs to have the scope of 'row' or 'col' to work.</p>
    <p>This is bit confusing for me, so I'm going to try to do it myself. I've created a small spreadsheet in LibreOffice Calc, and I'm going to try to recreate it in HTML according to accessible standards.</p>

    </table>

    <p>Okay, it isn't exactly amazing but it works and now I know about cool CSS selector tricks like :nth-child and :first-child and :not(), so I think it was worth it. </p>

    <p>Deque also shows how to associate certain cells with heading using the headers attribute, linking directly to each table heading's id.</p>

    <p>Additionally, nested tables breaking table heading and scope functionality so do NOT use them.</p>

    <h3>Table Summaries</h3>
    <p>A table summary is meant to improve understandability. Deque orients this towards SR users, but likely everyone can benefit from this. It lists a couple techniques that can be used to support this: putting it in figure's figcaption (pair with aria-labbeledby on the table itself), putting it in the caption element, visually hiding it, and associating a description with the table through aria-describedby.</p>
    <p>I'm incredibly suprised to learn that the "presentation" role exists. Harm reduction, I suppose. </p>

    <h3>Iframes</h3>
    <p>I know zero things about this. Should be fun!</p>
    <p>Iframes need a title. I feel like this is definitely something I've looked past before.</p>
    <p>Okay, I'm a bit bamboozled. There's a second page on titles that says the source page of the iframe must have a valid title (they're using MUST here, so it's WCAG). But we can't control some of these. It seems like this is specified because of JAWS behaviour. I'm kinda bamboozled, need to consult external sources.</p>
    <p>The wording is a little bit weird, but in a different section of Deque, they basically say that this weird behaviour is mostly concerned with documents. So documents also need an accessible name, and it should ideally be the same one as you put in the title attribute just so experience is the same across the board. I don't have JAWS so I can't test to see if this behaviour still persists.</p>
    <p>The thing about trying to preserve heading hierarchy between the child iframe and the parent website seems a bit strange. Say I was hosting a pdf file on my website, and just wanted to show a preview using an iframe. Should I mess with all the heading structure of the pdf just so that the iframe hierarchy structure should be presersved? This just leaves a really odd experience to anyone who uses the pdf file on its own, not in the context of the document. I'm sure it applies to some cases, but it feels weird.</p>
    <p>Use aria-hidden="true" for meaningless iframes. I feel like there should also be a bypass mechanism. </p>

    <h3>Not-so-useful Semantic Elements</h3>
    <p>I've never in my life heard of the 'q' element before. I'm also so surprised that their section on blockquotes is so sparse. Adrian and Heydon's guides are much more comprehensible, and illustrate how complex this element actual is below the surface.</p>
    <p>There's also a note on the code element. I am very bad at the code element. I write everything in raw HTML and the code element makes me backspace and double check that everything is oriented properly-- it's just a hassle. I genuinely think that if I insisted tagging every instance of code on the website by hand, it would make me want to not post to this website any more.</p>
    <p>The pre element is suggested to accompany large blocks of code. I've also never heard of pre. I'm excited to see it whenever it pops up in Heydon Pickering's HTML elements guide.</p>

    <p>del and ins should be used for strikethroughs and additions but must be supplemented with visually hidden text or some other kind of mechanism. The mark element is the same for highlighted text. Make sure visually hidden supplements are available for critical instances of these things.</p>

    <h3>Good Markup Practices</h3>
    <p>These were once all considered essential to meet 4.1.1 but now that's deprecated. Deque has preserved the pages relevant to this for posterity.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>ids should be unique on a page. This is also good for satisfying Name, Role, Value.</li>
    <li>Parent-child relationships are good. This is apparently most impactful when the ARIA roles are misaligned somehow.</li>
    <li>Don't use deprecated elements and attributes. Interesting how width as an attribute is deprecated on td and th, but is valid as a style.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Interlude: Course Complete!</h3>
    <p>I'm officially done the Semantic Structure and Navigation course. I'm going to just zoom through one of the easier ones now on Accessibility Fundamentals. I've covered a good part of this material already through other courses, but I suppose this is also a good course to just zoom past and secure the certificate.</p>

    <h3>Disability Fundamentals</h3>
    <p>It's pretty exhausting that every single instance of a Disabled person using tech has to somehow make the additional point that the Disabled person has thus 'overcome' their disability in some capacity. And that metric is decided by their ability to participate in civil society. Why can't some non-extroardinary people real people feature in these examples?</p>
    <p>This all just feel very outdated and like it was designed by people who don't know the field of Disability Studies, which is what my background is somewhat in. Much less Crip Studies.</p>
    <p>COGA goes far beyond just the one example they gave of Down Syndrome. It also betrays the reality of most folks with intelectual disability. Most of them don't have any particular diagnosis beyond the state of 'intellectual disability' generally, which is defined via a IQ test. If there was any place to give a wealth of different examples, this would have been the place.</p>
    <p>Meh. I have notes. They need to hire someone from the humanities to have at this course.</p>

    <h3>Distinguishing Links from Text</h3>
    <p>The wording here is a little ambiguous, whether it is necessary to provide a hover style that is not just a change in colour. It definitley is the case for links, I just don't know about hover styles. Is this WCAG?</p>
    <p><a href="https://www.tpgi.com/a-whole-lot-of-bovver-over-hover/">Ian Llyod of TPGi</a> makes the case that it is not a WCAG failure, as the hover is not seen as essential functioning. People can only trigger hover by moving their mouse to the required thing. Maybe if everyone was operating system with invisible mouses, this would be a requirement. But that isn't the case, so Ian doesn't think it fails any of the Contrast SC. Focus indicators, on the other hand, can fail Non-text Contrast.</p>
    <p>In other words, I don't need to fix the Hover style on this website!</p>
    <p>Deque also gives another friendly reminder that navigation menus are an exception for underlined links.</p>

    <h3>Interlude: My Website Needs a Skip Link</h3>
    <p>Rolling up my sleeves here. I've been putting it off because it looks scary. But I think it's time.</p>

    <h2 id="note-27">Access Trauma and the Aesthetic World</h2>
    <p>Noted October 17, 2024</p>
    
    <p>Mastodon seems to be my newest way to pick up new articles to read up on. I am feeling more optimistic than usual, a client actually might be on the horizon. I am terrified. I feel the stakes.</p>

    <p>It's apt that I somehow came across the work of <a href="https://robertkingett.com/map/">Robert Kingett</a>, whos articles I'll be doing commentary on today. I've been doing so much work on the technical side of things and haven't paused much to examine the more theoretical, justice-based aspect of what it means to participate in the accessibility space. I've been thinking about what it means to set a rate for my services. What am I profitting off of? How do I participate in this space in a way that is most world-building? How do I embark on my own internal accessibility journey as a Disabled subject myself, with many access priviledges that the people I am advocating on behalf of don't have?</p>

    <h3>1. <a href="https://robertkingett.com/posts/6617/">Combatting Access Trauma</a></h3>
    <p>I suppose I am struck by a hence of devastation in reading this. There is nothing positive about access trauma. I think it mirrors how I've seen some BIPOC narrate their experiences of racism, and it mirrors how I've seen some Indigenous people narrate the experience of settler colonialism over generations. Kingett uses the words, 'relentless, unforgiving.' As if there was some sin on the part of the victim that brought this upon themself.</p>
    <p>Access trauma. I don't experience that. When I audit stuff, I experience, perhaps a empathetic version of access frustration. I might say, 'Please, you should have known better. I don't know HTML and even I know this is clearly wrong.' I always have so much empathy for that person who designed the inaccessible website. I don't easily perceive the harm.</p>
    <p>Perhaps it relates somewhat to this other feeling I've had recently: My ASL is not that great and it won't get great until I use it a whole bunch. Hearing people get all up in arms about the idea that only Deaf people are allowed to teach ASL, or that Deaf people have the final say on what ASL is and is not. But hearing people don't carry that access trauma that has caused ASL to flourish into the beautiful linguistic miracle that it is, despite all of the horrid persecution that has attacked. Perhaps ASL is beautiful because of that persecution. I'm rambling at this point.</p>
    <p>I also think about the beauty of Protactile. And in reading Kingett describe the pursuit to "cultivate spaces where [they] don't have to battle access trauma," I think about how generative those results can be. The whole of humanity is better for it when Deaf and Disabled people live in systems that include them. </p>
    <p>Reading my words back, I think the word 'beauty' might not be coming across in the way that I intend it to, and my inner Tokiponist is not satisified with that. I think it is good when people can take care of each other while living autonymously in kinship environments that can catch them when they fall. I would like to live in a world like that. And I see that happening linguistically in the languages of ASL and Protactile.</p>
    <p>The feeling described in Kingett's article appears to me that it doesn't apply to people who only have temporary disabilities. I suppose my question would be: is access trauma characteristic of what it means to be Disabled? Could we perhaps even use this framework as a kind of litmus test? What harms come from exercising this idea?</p>
    <p>In my own work as a communicator, how do I convey the urgency to people who are not Disabled? Are the words, 'relentless and unforgiving' resonant?</p>

    <h3>2. <a href="https://robertkingett.com/posts/6567/">TTS Audio Description</a></h3>

    <p>I once was sitting opposite a very well-respected accessibility advocate in my city. She's potentially the most respected in the entire city. I was asking her about why the videos on a certain platform that she was responsible for, weren't audio-described. I had only started to embark on my journey. I was curious, but I was also a bit judgemental. She looked at me shamefully but confident, and answered as if she hated every single syllable that left her mouth. She described that during COVID, they had released a batch of videos that sought to educate Disabled people on the benefits of vaccination, and to prepare them for the rollout process. They paid an enormous sum to get these videos audio described. It took up a very substantial part of their budget. To date, these videos have 2 views each.</p>
    <p>There was a very real financial argument for the 'undue hardship' placed on this organization to meet this requirement. It was a non-profit that could not even grant benefits to half of their full-time employees.</p>
    <p>And this was my first introduction to the realm of audio description as an accessibility requirement and how hard of a barrier it is to meet.</p>
    <p>Kingett's article describes the practice of Text-to-Speech Audio Description as being craft-less. Audio Description is an art of its own, and the offloading of such an art to AI scriptors and speech synthesizers does not appreciate this fact. It is not enjoyable. It does not create a beautiful experience, it creates mere compliance. It's sterile, flattenned, void of colour. "It's not inclusive," Kingett writes.</p>
    <p>This is a good article for me to be exposed to. I understand this argument. I had never been exposed to the aesthetic experience of audio description before. As an artsy person, I resonate with this. I agree that it's horrifically sterile. It also makes me want to learn how to write audio description and to explore it as a medium of art unto itself.</p>
    <p>For videos like that vaccine information one, perhaps the cost minimization that the AI tools could provide would be worth it. A person does not walk into a vaccine information video to be aesthetically pleased. But the other side of this is that AI makes mistakes, and I can't imagine how sensitive it would be in conveying such important information as a human could.</p>
    <p>This does make me increasingly interested in learning at least the fundamentals of audio description. I already have skills like making transcripts and caption writing. It seems like a skill that wouldn't not be useful to have.</p>
    <p>Blind audio description writers remind me slightly of Deaf interpreters. Deaf interpreters work alongside a hearing ASL-English interpreter to communicate to another Deaf person in the most reflects Deaf worldviews and visual communication culture. They often are called to interpret high-stakes situations when there can be no misunderstandings in meanings. They also may be employed in mental health contexts. Between blind AD writers, and Deaf interpreters, there is this idea that there is a cultural layer that only fellow peers have access to. When this cultural layer is involved, the level of inclusion spikes wildly. We're not really talking about sterile accessibility in this case, we're talking about something more.</p>

    <h3>3. <a href="https://audio.mcsweeneys.net/transcripts/against_access.html">Against Access, by John Lee Clark</a></h3>
    <p>I somehow also stumbled upon this piece in my Mastodon feed today, and it brings together ideas that I've been talking through from the previous two articles.</p>
    <p>I'd prefer that you read the text again instead of looking at my summary here. John Lee Clark is DeafBlind and is one of the leading figures in the new Protactile movement. Protactile is a language that was developed by DeafBlind, for DeafBlind, and emerged naturally when DeafBlind started to meet together without using sighted interpreters. It is also a philosophy about making freedom where you won't be provided it, creating communities of peers, and prioritizing your own aesthetic experience instead of trying to model the hearing and sighted world within your own home.</p>
    <p>In this essay, John Lee Clark describes an alternate to the paradigm of 'accessibility.' Instead of prioritizing 'how to make the thing accessible,' prioritize beauty within the constraints of the tactile world, and then run with that. For Clark, the sterility and near scientific hunt for accuracy that proponents of 'access' hunt leaves the emotional and beautiful world unrepresented in a series of highly 'accurate' but unappealing replicas. In order to achieve inclusion, Clark needed more than just translation. He needed a transformation of the information to fit the way that he navigates the world. He needed whatever 'translation' to accomodate the communication values that he has as a Protactile user.</p>
    <p>I suppose reading this article, the conclusion I come to is that access is not enough if we want to create a world that is beautiful for Disabled people. It doesn't mean that the goal of accessibility is any less noble, it just means that it is egotistical to assume that it alone is sufficient to create the endgame. Accessibility, as John Lee Clark narrates it, cannot create joy. That is the work of some other goal. Maybe, full participation of Disabled people in society is what we need to fix this.</p>

    <h2 id="note-26">Articles and Shmarticles</h2>
    <p>Noted October 16, 2024</p>

    <p>I have a lot of administrative things to do today, so my session might be very brief. Yesterday, tables did a number on my psyche. But it might just be the person talking. Faulkner re-linked a post on tables that they wrote back in May, so we're gonna start with that.</p>

    <h3>1. <a href="https://html5accessibility.com/stuff/2024/05/22/not-so-short-note-on-aria-label-usage-big-table-edition/">Steve Faulkner on Tables and aria-label</a></h3>
    <p>I haven't actually come across the words 'implicit' and 'explicit' yet, but I understood this concept when I had my 'aha! moment' regarding roles five days ago. Faulkner pairs this glossary with a couple of rules for labelling. Labels that are visible are better than labels that are hidden, and when present, should behave as expected (after checkboxes and radio, before everything else) and you should rely on native roles over any kind of ARIA implementation.</p>
    <p>Hmmm, I don't know of any scenario where an anchor element with a valid destination should be given an aria-label that overrides text content. Maybe if it's an image, and you wanna override the alt text? Regardless, Steve indicates that this is a valid case. </p>
    <p>Also discusses some potential misuse of the abbr (abbreviation) element that I am most certainly guilty of on another one of my websites. Very conflicted on how to provide an accessible experience for that one. Maybe some kind of hidden text thingamajig would help. It's a pretty unique case and it is particularly ideological. I'll deal with it later, back to Faulkner's content.</p>
    <p>Good to note that aria-label is not supported in blockquotes very well.</p>
    <p>I should start marking code using the code element, but I don't know where to start. Let's test it now. <code>aria-describedby</code>. I don't know anything really about how this affects different user experiences. <a href="https://www.digitala11y.com/wai-aria-rolecode/">DigitalA11Y discusses role=code</a> in relation to how it presents on screen readers. The screen reader will read out exact punctuation. This is another diversion, back to main content.</p>
    <p>Interestingly, it overrides the legend element in fieldset, and overrides figcaption in figure.</p>
    <p>So it should NOT be used for images, which means the alt shouldn't be the accessible name. What's the point with it being okay to use on 'anchor' then?</p>
    <p>Key takeaway from this article that I'm getting after looking over all the Things: just because you can add an ARIA label to something, and it is permitted under WAI-ARIA 1.2 specification, it doesn't mean you should do it.</p>

    <h3>2. <a href="https://www.matuzo.at/blog/building-the-most-inaccessible-site-possible-with-a-perfect-lighthouse-score">Matzuo's Perfect Lighthouse Score with Piss-Poor Accessibility</a></h3>
    <p>I have heard rumours of this article, but today was the first time I saw it linked, so let's dive in!</p>
    <p>A delightful read! A lot of these feel like 'gotchas' and I wanted slightly more real-life feeling instances to drive the point home that this happens all the time on real, breathing website, and not just a website that is optimized to be unusable. Though, I suppose this article is speaking to people who don't have a good idea of different ways technology can support alternative user experiences, so it has to target itself at the seeing population of mouse-users.</p>

    <h3>3. <a href="https://www.tpgi.com/making-the-web-accessible-a-focus-on-cognitive-disabilities/">Cognitive Accessibility with Melissa Morse</a></h3>
    <p>Plain language is something I'm interested in, but the practice itself appears to be poorly defined. Sometimes using simple words is actually obfuscating, I know this as a Toki Pona speaker. Toki Pona requires a person to break down things into their basic components, but then it requires the interlocutor to really zone in and lesson to the relationships that join all of these very simple parts together. It's a process that can be quite mentally taxing. Of course, they're not talking about this when they say 'plain language.' But from my view, 'plain language' seems like something that is very easy to not get right. I wonder how the field of plain language specialitists sorts itself out. I saw a website of such a person the other day.</p>
    <p>Interesting that within this first section of the article, Morse doesn't offer the idea of 'language summaries.' I'm a big fan of this.</p>
    <p>A final comment is given to the increased focus of COGA in the latest WCAG. They're all triple A standards though. Unusual Words, Abbreviations, Reading Level, and Pronounciation. I don't know how people evaluate 'Reading Level.' What is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flesch%E2%80%93Kincaid_readability_tests">Flesch-Kincaid readability test</a>? Oh my god, it measures syllables per word. I promise you, I am capable of writing some really freaking dense thing using minimal syllables. This is not a good formula. They're also not speaking toki pona. This seems a bit underthought. </p>

    <p>Noted October 15, 2024</p>
    <p>Back after a long weekend. Let's get cracking, lads!</p>
    <h3>Single-Key Shortcuts</h3>
    <p>Deque brings up the example of Gmail as having lots of keyboard shortcuts. I remember I was trying to use it a while back. Native keyboard navigation was not great. I couldn't seem to open any emails and I had to just enable keyboard for that. Some other applet thingies have a learning curve with keyboard navigation. Slack, I couldn't manage to figure out either. I have a low attention span and it just didn't work out for me.</p>
    <p>Also on the topic of single-key shortcuts, I have a bookmarklet but I don't entirely know how to operate it. I should learn to do that at some point. Alright, I feel like I know what's up now. The wording on the ReadMe is a little bit weird, but I get it now.</p>

    <h3>Distraction: CSS</h3>
    <p>I'm literally spending so much time just styling my focus indicator in new interesting ways, and adjusting my colour palette. My hover indicator is cool now! </p>

    <h3>Tables</h3>
    <p>Tables should be named via caption or aria-labeledby and you shouldn't use weird spanned columns because it can be frustrating to navigate. column or row headers need to have to be meaningfully described in a th element and must have an appropriate scope attribute (either "row" or "col").</p>

    <h3>Showing the Current Page</h3>
    <p>I added styles in my main nav to indicate the current page, and I also added aria-current="page" to those same things. I feel like I don't typically notice when this feature is implemented, but I suppose I will start noticing now. I kinda wanna learn how to implement a skip link. And speaking of which...</p>

    <h3>Skip Links</h3>
    <p>I was reading the portion on Skip Links and became curious about how it related to SC 2.4.1 Bypass Blocks. Because the keyword that Deque uses for these things is 'should' instead of 'must.' Which means it isn't actually in the WCAG, and this was surprising to me! What else could bypass blocks possibly be solved by? First I read the official wording, <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/bypass-blocks.html">SC 2.4.1 Bypass Blocks from W3C</a>, and then I read through this <a href="https://github.com/w3c/wcag/issues/1712">Issue thread for 2.4.1 Sufficient Techniques.</a> I totally agree that H69 should be removed as a sufficient technique. Actually I agree most of the sufficient techniques grouped under section 2 are very suspect. Reading through all the a11y people talking about this was quite illuminating.</p>
    <p>Eric Eggert in particular had a couple notes about what it means to be listed as a sufficient technique. As did Steven Faulkner.</p>
    <p>Something I am still curious about: What if your nav has like 3 items? Should a skip link still be provided? Is it needed? It really doesn't save that much time.</p>

    <h2 id="note-23">Preparing for a Potential Client</h2>
    <p>Noted October 12, 2024</p>

    <p>Have a potential client, and I've promised to send them a bit of a package for them to review prior to our first meeting. But I don't quite know the direction I'm going to take this, so let's start by taking a look at their website. If I know what the endgame is, I can prepare for it.</p>

    <p>I'm typing this out here because I have major task avoidance regarding this, so here's to hoping it all turns out well. Watching Matuzovic yesterday doing preliminary audits was oddly motivating.</p>

    <p>Here are some things I am noticing in the audit:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>This case doesn't need a lot of work. They've clearly run basic tests with accessibility in mind: axe picks up only one region declaration suggestion, no errors, and no critical errors are abound at all. It is fairly impressive.</li>
      <li>But there are still broken features. For example, the bypass blocks mechanism bypasses more than the navigation and actually skips past pretty important content. This is a very easy fix, but it's probably the most glaring issue of all that I see, and it's actually the first thing that made me consider approaching this client.</li>
      <li>Reflow is also not perfect. The dev has opted to put a lot of content into a banner style thing that probably has some kind of fixed width. For aesthetic purposes, it opts to cut off content instead of reflowing it properly. That's the second worse thing.</li>
      <li>There was a pretty critical issue early on where absolutely no navigation functionality was available on mobile view. That has since been solved, I actually noticed that quite a while ago.</li>
      <li>The person has gone for a pdf indication (which is great!) but has used the title attribute instead of aria-labeledby and visibility-hidden. Another good solve would be putting it in alt text. But they did think to include it. They did go so far. They also have a shit ton of amazing labeled-by implementation on the blogs and 'learn more' sections of the site.</li>
      <li>So that was present on a key pdf. But the content authors that are normally on the site don't do this kind of thing. The content authors also don't often add alt text. The whole 'Sponsorship' sections for one of their evenets was just littered with linked images with the file names as set alt text. It wasn't pretty to look at.
      </li>
      <li>Consistent navigation is another potential failure. Let me back up a second, recently, this client had a rebrand and had a whole other website built from the ground up. For whatever reason, they did not adapt their e-commerce section (Event registration) or Event portal. All of that functionality of their website is redirected from the new site to the old site. And the old site and new site differ in navigation. I have to presume that their plan is to eventually reincorporate a new version of the event site. But I don't know exactly.</li>
      <li>There is also some things regarding the degree of feedback the user gets after input that would be nice. Not all of the search functionalities provide feedback in the header title element as to what things are. Autofocus after searching would also be a nice touch. These are all things that are nice to have, but not essential.</li>
      <li>I am also slightly worried about the use of captchas on the site. And I haven't yet seen anything about cognitive tests, but I am still learning about that criterion so I shouldn't speak too soon.</li>
      <li>Testing on mobile is quite revealing. It is not.. Good.</li>

    <h3>span links</h3>
    <p>Nice to see the whole role="link" tabindex="0" pattern laid out for me because I would have thought that the role="link" would have been enough for the thing to receive focus.</p>
    <p>Also good to see that horrid span Javascript not-link pattern called out as a 'Bad Example' in this text. I came across it on my own a week or so ago and was so horrified. I suppose the way this pattern could be vaguely improved is role="link" and tabindex="0" but it's just bad. Oh it's so bad.</p>
    <h3>Link label precedence</h3>
    <p>title will be overtaken by anchor text (including alt text), which will be overtaken by aria-label, which will be overtaken by aria-labelledby. This makes aria-labelledby misuse potential because it can override what would otherwise be considered 'normal' behaviour.</p>
    <h3>Visually hidden text</h3>
    <p>Okay so I've seen many snippets use some kind of form of this but I've never stared right into the logistics before. clip is used to make the text invisible and it looks like it clips out a shape from the..? What? Let's look into this with another source. </p>
    <p>Whoa okay so according to the<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/clip">MDN web docs for 'clip'</a>, the feature is deprecated and replaced by '<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/clip-path">clip-path</a>.'</p>
    <p>I am confused. What is a shape function? wow it can move?! What?!</p>
    <p>Okay a lot of this doesn't apply to my use case. I am going to look elsewhere for examples of hiding text from sighted users and shoving it onto screen reader users. Let's peak in on an artical by <a href="https://www.makethingsaccessible.com/guides/visually-hiding-text/">Darren Lee.</a></p>
    <p>Darren's first example illustrates where a mismatched aria-label can fail Label in Name and can prevent voice-navigation people from accessing your content. Darren eventually goes on to show a custom .visually-hidden class in CSS and uSo Deque gives this example that a role="navigation" shouldn't directly be applied to a ul. The rationale is that the "ul" already has a role as an unordered list and the navigation role would override that.
      ses both clip and clip-path to achieve it. Very confusing because there is not explanation of this code.</p>
    <p>Time for a new article, this time by <a href="https://www.tpgi.com/the-anatomy-of-visually-hidden/">James Edwards at TPGi</a>. And the question's answered, and many other things clarified. What we essentially do is make whatever content we have into a 1px by 1px square, and then use clip/clip-path to hide it. clip, being deprecated, is included in the pattern to support Internet Explorer. Technically, most browsers support a 0 width and 0 height on this pattern. But Safari's the one exception, so we can't just ignore them. And this fantastic article also links to a really great O'Hara article that advocates that we need to fix other things so this pattern is not needed. Edwards refers to .visually-hidden as a 'hack.' I think that's accurate.</p>

    <h3>Distraction Time: Live Auditing on YouTube</h3>
    <p>Found a set of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1-dDbgQP5E&list=PLfynVUhSmWhPNEu1bgPMhCbkz9fTGlPep">videos by Manuel Matuzovic</a> that have him walking through websites checking for accessibility features. It's really cool to see someone else do this in real time! And I am kinda excited by the fact that I know everything he's talking about. It's in German, but Matuzovic has captioned his videos and so the auto-translate works amazingly. Good stuff!</p>
    <h3>Consistent Navigation</h3>
    <p>I didn't know the whole rule applies to link text + destination. Makes sense though!</p>

    <h3>ARIA role breakthrough</h3>
    <p>So Deque gives this example that a role="navigation" shouldn't directly be applied to a ul. The rationale is that the "ul" already has a role as an unordered list and the navigation role would override that.</p>
    <p>This helps me better understand what a 'role' is. Because of course as we all know, roles are already baked into HTML5 and when we use most native elements, we don't need any kind of ARIA role applied. Here's the kicker: because it already has a role. ARIA roles and the native roles are the same thing. I thought they were somehow different! AA okay but they aren't. They are the same thing. What does this look like on the back end?</p>
    <p>Okay here's another breakthrough. People have been talking so much about the 'Accessibility Tree' right and I've really had little idea of what they meant by that. I of Course saw that whole Accessibility panel in the Firefox inspect panel. But I didn't ever.. look on the left side of the screen? I was just looking at the 'Name' column and not the 'Role column.' But it's all there. It's all there for you. It's so obvious. Oh my gosh I can't believe I missed this. Before people were talking as if it was so obvious to find the role of any given thing and I was so perplexed by How it was possible. I thought that people had memorized that oh, anchor elements have the role of 'link' and all these various things have these various roles. I thought they were getting all of this from the pure HTML but No. This makes So Much More Sense. Part of my 'Aha' moment can be attributed to this handy tool that lists <a href="https://russmaxdesign.github.io/html-elements-names/">HTML elements by accessible role by browser</a> in a handy little chart.</p>

    <h3>Distraction Time: Trauma-Informed Design</h3>
    <p><a href="https://dfrlbook.com/chapter1">Design for Real Life</a> is free now! says Mastodon. It has a very impactful Chapter 1. But the lack of attention of accesssibility within the online version of the text has me thinking that while this is a text I should get to eventually, maybe it shouldn't be my priority now.</p>

    <h3>h1 comments</h3>
    <p>Good to see Deque reiterate the 'one h1' guidelines. I previously had trouble sourcing this, I had seen it on a Yale guide but I had to hunt it over and over again. Interesting exceptions for overlays, and for blogs constructed similarly like this one. I think that the way that I've set this up is accessible? Right now, I have a 'back to notes' link at the bottom of every entry. I like this because I can navigate easy to the table of contents when I'm on Keyboard only mode, like I am now. I am unsure how convenient it is for screen reader usability. It might mess with the amount of links. It's also probably not great that every single blog post is smashed onto one page. It would be a bit beyond me right now to separate them out into distinct pages. Maybe I should reconsider this at some point, for ease of navigation purposes.</p>
    <p>Why, oh why, is it not possible to navigate via heading on VoiceOver and TalkBack? Is there any particular reason that this function isn't supported? Is it not suitable? Seems suspect.</p>

    <p>Noted October 9, 2024</p>

    <p>I'm getting lazier about recording down the progress of my learning. I've started on the module titled Semantic Strucuture and Navigation. Here are some things I'm struggling with:</p>
    <h3>Accessing Landmark menu on Talkback</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>I can't manage to access any function that will list all landmarks. Deque gives these instructions: Swipe up and right to access the local context menu, then 'landmarks will pop up.' </li>
      <li>When I do this though, here are the options it gives me: Read from focused item, Copy last spoken phrase, Spoken language, Screen search, Hide screen, Voice commands, TalkBack settings, Text-to-speech settings, Braille display settings.</li>
      <li>There's nothing about landmarks. I went into the 'customize talkback menu' area of settings and there was nothing there to enable landmark navigation either. Which sucks. Or maybe I'm just doing the gesture wrong, who knows.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Language shifting</h3>
    <p>So, you're supposed to change the language whenever you have text in another language. Even on the word-by-word basis. To what extent does this apply? There are many loan words in English. Loaning is such a popular mechanism for word formation.</p>
    <p>Here's some tangible instances that I can think of: Often, fans of anime will refer to that anime by its Japanese title instead of the English one. But they will write the title out in latin characters. For example, a fan of Attack on Titan might say: "I love Shingeki no Kyojin! It's my favourite anime. I think everyone should watch SnK." Do I have to put language tags around that? In theory, the title has just been loaned. It isn't even in the Japanese script. But they are unambiguously words that aren't in English. Do we put them in a span and tag them as Japanese?</p>
    <p>What about websites that are teaching language? Do they have to tag every single instance of the foreign language with alternate tags? That can really add up.</p>
    <p>What if the language doesn't have a two digit ISO code? What if it has a three-digit one? Does it make sense to provide a two-digit one as a backup if the screen reader doesn't support it? For example, Spanish is a very popular choice for rendering Toki Pona. How does that even work? Is there some kind of query you can do to check for that? I have no idea how that works out logistically.</p>

    <h3>Backwards compatibility</h3>
    <p>Deque recommends setting all landmarks to display as block and to use Javascript to preload tags that may not be support in Internet Explorer 8 and below. I would have liked for them to spell out IE without acronymning it, but whatever. I do like to see these examples of techniques that can be applied pretty consistantly and that really cater to inclusive design.</p>

    <h3>Who Benefits from Landmarks</h3>
    <p>Deque suggests that there is little benefit for sighted users for landmarks, or really anyone outside of screen reader users. That's why they introduce the ARIA roles and html5 elements as interchangeable. A correctly placed main does help everyone though. Are there ways to access these through switch controls? There really should be, that seems like a really good feature. A Google search reveals that other folks have thought the same thing and implemented it through an aptly named <a href="https://www.tpgi.com/improving-access-to-landmark-navigation/">Landmark Extension</a>.</p>

    <p>Briefly, I'm reminded of what Heydon says how we will never know our users, and we should never seek to know our users, and we don't need to know them. We just need to design for the technology.</p>

    <h3>role="heading"</h3>
    <p>I don't like this but I understand why it's there. Is it possible to apply ARIA roles in CSS? Is that a stupid question to ask? Yes it is probably. I thought I read somewhere at some point that aria-level was a broken attribute in some browsers, but I completely forget where I read that and I might have literally dreamed it.</p>
    <p>Note to self: a classic definition of a heading in plato's cave must have content associated under it. Or else it ain't a heading.</p>

    <h3>Technique for New Window Indication</h3>
    <p>The idea behind this is to use describedby to point to a piece of text that is both .visually-hidden and aria-hidden that is then put onto an anchor element. I'm ever skeptical of aria, so let's look at other sources to see whether there's issue with this kind of implementation.</p>
    <p><a href="https://adrianroselli.com/2022/04/accessible-description-exposure.html">Adrian's article on aria-describedby</a> features a lot of video evidence as to how this interacts with different engines. And it's not supported universally in all contexts. Adrian recommends to not rely on this for critical information. In the thing suggested by Deque, this is probably fine. The information is not critical, it's unprescence doesn't fail a WCAG criterion specifically. But it is not great. Adrian also links to some other articles and I'll take a peak at those too.</p>

    <p><a href="https://www.tpgi.com/describing-aria-describedby/">O'Hara's aria-describedby article</a> is from 2018, but it's still clarifying. aria-describedby is only used in interactive areas, with some edge cases. Scott makes a similar conclusion that while the feature is very useful and good, relying on it critically and uniquely is a no-go.</p>

    <p>Also nice to come across aria-described and just as normal, it's Safari that's dragging everyone else behind. Catch up, Apple.</p>

    <p>Deque also suggests that outside websites should be noted externally. Disapointing that there's no easy icon or whatever that shows this.</p>

    <h3>Links must be visually distinguishable</h3>
    <p>Cue Heydon and their 'Underline your fucking links, nerds!' or whataever it was. If it is in an obvious navigation then it doesn't count. That was the one piece I was missing.</p>
    <p>In terms of people who don't want to underline their links, uh contrast ration of 3:! is pretty drastic.</p>

    <h3>Weird Question</h3>
    <p>With aria-desrcribedby and aria-described being in such states they are in, is it permissible to fuck with an image so that the image doesn't appear but the alt text will appear on hover if there is a screen-reader user? That doesn't seem right but I wonder about how bad it could possibly be. </p>

    <p>Applied for the scholarship to Deque's prep courses for IAAP and WAS. That will give a lot better structure to my learning than has been given so far. Working with freeCodeCamp is okay, but it's very not great when their recommendations are not accessible or best practice, and that happens a lot. Completing those modules will also just be a way to list the courses I complete on my portfolio directly. I don't need to take IAAP, or WAS. I hope I get it!</p>

    <p>We're also learning about the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/using-aria/#secondrule">Second Rule of ARIA</a>, which I am less familiar with. Do not change native semantics. Maybe this is otherwise worded as don't use an HTML element in a way that makes it appear as something else and it becomes confusing as to what it actually is?</p>
    <p>Adrian clarifies the intention of the menu, menubar and menuitem ARIA roles. They are intended to be used to act like a desktop application. Like VScode, for example, has a menu bar in the top. web applications aren't like this. The vibes are different.</p>
    <p>Adrian also clarifies that the HTML5 element nav should be used in most scenarios over the ARIA role 'navigation.' This ARIA role is the role</p>

    <p>This helped. I asked it to really, really dumb it down for me and to focus on it's relation to SC Name, Role, Value. Basically, WAI-ARIA helps in the design of some advanced components that don't have native HTML equivelants. It can also be used for live region alerts, when designers insist on using placeholder= as a label, for Icon-only buttons. Most of this can be revealed using Devtools when auditing. I'm going to try to look at Roselli's articles listed under ARIAbuse.</p>

This was a good window into seeing how the authoring practices guide might get things wrong sometimes. Also, don't use grid unless you're trying to recreate Excel.</p>

    <p>Yesterday, I wound myself all up and got into shutdown mode. I closed all my tabs, turned off the 'limit' timer on TikTok and YouTube, wrapped myself in my weighted blanked, and took time to myself. It's hard to explain the amount of factors yesterday. I'm reminded about the article about spoons and neurodivergency, and I felt that in action yesterday. Some unexpected things happened yesterday during the day, and when my touchpad's settings got overrided by a ghost yesterday, I completely broke. And as a result, I don't want to learn about WAI-ARIA today. I need someone to tell me how to do it. The video I tried to watch wasn't helpful. I still feel so ashamed. It's such a little thing but it feels like everything. So we're going to be kinder to ourselves today. And we can get back to WAI-ARIA on Monday.</p>

    <h3>Articles</h3>

    <p>I recently was taught the explicit+implicit pattern in freeCodeCamp, so it was good to see that they were doing something right. It was a surprise to learn about implicit association, but I suppose it makes sense, though why doesn't Dragon support this? To be fair, Dragon doesn't seem to support many things. Does it even support ARIA? I was reading yesterday that it might now. But that article was from a while ago, should check again.</p>

    <p>I basically know everything here already but I was interested in this article because I never heard the word 'sensor' used this way before. Fascinating. How do devices actually sense gestures like shaking the device? Is there a little eardrum and eardrum fluid in the device? Is it a tiny wee ball that rolls back and forth? Not to mention, how does the device know that I am holding it upside down?</p>
    <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accelerometer">Accelerometers</a> measure the force of acceleration on itself at any given time and can therefore determine the angle it is held at based on how the acceleration changes, unless the device is in free fall.That's how devices know where they are oriented in space. But it can't tell what direction it is pointed, that is determined by magnetic sensors that are pointed at Magnetic North.</p>

Which would be a different conversation, I think. How do we make location information and complex directions accessible to Blind people? A map is such a visual medium, would a medium change be necessary here? The article is short and doesn't answer this question.</p>

    <p>ARIA is the scariest part about all of this. I'm actually very nervous to get into this. I don't know where to start. I have <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/aria/">the WAI-ARIA Overview page</a> open in front of me. This is honestly very scary and I haven't even started it. Let's read the introduction. Or something. Let's just start taking notes. Can't keep procrastinating and stalling by typing poetry here. Or maybe I can. Who reads this? Who waits for me here? Are you waiting for me to give up this facade, to tell you some new information, are you only here to mock me?</p>

    <p>How do people even pronounce UAAG? Is it a groan? Because that's how I feel right now.</p>

    <p>I am done the page. I don't understand some things. Does 'rich' Internet applications mean that it was funded by more than one dollar? How is it that most form controls are readonly? Don't you have to.. use them? What? Also, when I'm using a keyboard I have no freaking idea how to access these secret region-marked navigation techniques. Are they just referring to screen readers as 'keyboard-only users' here or what exactly is going on? What page do I click on next?</p>

    <p>Looking at <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.2/">WAI-ARIA 1.2</a> actually gives me a panic attack. What the hell is this?</p>

    <p>Deep breaths. I'm so disoriented that my touchpad is behaving incredibly weirdly and whenever I disable my touchpad using my keyboard shortcut, it just doesn't get disabled. WTF. Also Slack just kicked me out because I use Firefox ESR. What is the world even coming to?</p>

    <p>I'm going to watch a video and swear to god if this is trash I'm going to go and make myself tofu.</p>

    <p>I AM EXTREMELY DISORIENTED. WHY IS IT NOT LETTING ME DISABLE MY KEYBOARD.</p>

    <p>Here's the deal: all of my keyboard settings have been completely overriden by a fucking ghost. Two finger scrolling is disabled. The speed is all innacurate. It's all wrong. It's all wrong! And that would normally be fine because I can now navigate by Keyboard but it's NOT LETTING ME DISABLE IT. And it doesn't get disabled when I'm typing so FUCK!</p>

    <h2 id="note-15">Scatterbrained Notes</h2>
    <p>Noted October 3, 2024</p>

    <p>Haven't updated here in a few days, but I've been caught up in freeCodeCamp, as well as with case studies. Here's some random things I've learned about during that time:</p>





    <h3>Widgets, in a Squarespace Website</h3>
    <p>I was on a squarespace website that looked promising. It was fairly simple, with apparently no form elements, so I thought it would be a doozy. And then the widgets. Two widgets injected into the native site: one of which could not be tabbed onto, and the other was hell to operate by keyboard alone. I didn't even get to evaluating these widgets thoroughly, I was so perplexed by how widgets are made and sold and incoporated into these otherwise okay websites. One of them, a take-out ordering system that didn't receive focus, was a span element with two scripts underneath it. It seems it was the scripts that button-ified the span in some way, but that wasn't available within the HTML markup, so it bamboozled me. How could it be a button, if it was just a span with no visible anchor element?</p>
    <p>This got me thinking. Initially, I would have figured that the fix would be simple: just add a tabindex=0 to the span. But if the anchor element was made within the Javascript and if it had all of the styles applied secondarily, would that even work?</p>
    <p>I tried in the Inspector and it worked. So I was confused. Because surely, if there was no focus there, the Javascript must have somehow overruled the tabindex to be -1 or something. Something must have been done to override the native anchor behaviour. Unless.. maybe there are ways to make links that don't require anchor elements?</p>

    <p>And then I found <a href="https://www.willmaster.com/library/web-development/linking-without-an-a-tag.php">this horrible anchor-less span link pattern</a> hosted on a website with some of the worst tab indexing I've seen in my life. Now, I am not so proficient to decipher whether this is the exact kind of pattern that this widget-maker used to get their span to become a link, but just knowing that this is out there makes my stomach churn. This should honestly not exist.</p>
    <p>The same widget-maker also manually set all of their tabindexing using positive values. Seeing that in the wild was honestly wild.</p>

    <p>I don't want to comment much on the second widget, a reservation booking platform, because being that keyboard navigation was neigh impossible, it's obvious that whoever made this website did not account fo accessibility when choosing a vendor.</p>

    <h3>Smaller Note on Text Contrast</h3>
    <p>On a couple websites, there was a bunch of floating light-coloured text against some kind of busy background. I was thinking about ways to remediate this. My first instinct is to put a solid border around the text itself.But that isn't a property that exists in CSS, right?</p>
    <p>Here's <a href="https://kinsta.com/blog/css-text-outline/">how to add an outline to text</a>, using two different properties. -webkit-text-stroke is one option, but it doesn't have great interoperability. text-shadow requires a little bit more work but it has better support. This should be a strategy that can remediate for contrast requirements across many of these websites. I hadn't noticed it before, but Adrian Roselli uses this a lot on his blog.</p>

    <p>My brain is going, "See? A11y isn't about what we have to subtract, it's about what we add to our plate!" and simultaneously I'm thinking of an example of a nav that had something like 120 links in it that I saw the other day. Certainly we can cut out some of those links, right? Shift left, shift left, shift left.</p>

    <h3>Ethical Dilemna</h3>
    <p>The most accessible website that I found during these past few days was built using a website builder and hosting service that is owned and operated by colonizers of Palestinian land. Finding that out was like a suckerpunch to the gut. I am really comforted by people like Heydon Pickering and Steven Faulkner who champion progressive values within the accessibility work, and I especially like the <a href="https://heydonworks.com/hire/">tagline</a> that Heydon has on their website: "I do not work with surveillance capitalists or religious organizations engaged in proselytization."</p>
    <p>I need to be so vigilant and selective about which organizations I approach when all of this gets off the ground.</p>
    <p>Two minutes later update: I just found another website made by the same hosting service and the accessibility is NONEXISTANT. So glad to see this!</p>

    <p>It's a bold title, I know. And it's also probably preemptive. I started on the 'Responsive Web Design' course offered by FreeCodeCamp and I see not great accessibility practices. Accessibility is an essential criteria, why not teach good accessibility practices throughout? Why are you recommending these contrast things that kill WCAG Contrast (Minimum), why are we suggesting to use target="_blank" by default, why are we putting alt text on decorative images?</p>
    <p>Like, I understand. This is an entry level course to people who have never done anything computer-related before in their life. And I see the eight or so modules down, there a big thing dedicated to 'Web Accessibility.' But if we are talking about shifting left, we need to integrate these things from the beginning. How hard is it to just mention, this is a decorative image, so let's set the alt text to null? Even mention that WCAG exists! Gosh sake.</p>

    <p>It's so frustrating because the course does bring up the word 'accessibility' more frequently than you'd think. But it doesn't actually teach WCAG-compliant practices, much less best practices. Of course, I'm only on the third module. It just feels icky.</p>

    <p>I am curious, is the website freeCodeCamp.org itself WCAG 2.2 AA Compliant? I would be surprised if it is. I'm now used to expecting inaccessibility by default. I don't need to get this heated. Slow and steady wins the race.</p>

    <h2 id="note-13">Inclusive Checklist(s)</h2>
    <p>Noted September 26, 2024</p>

    <p>I happened upon Adrian Roselli's <a href="https://adrianroselli.com/2019/08/basic-custom-control-requirements.html">Basic Custom Control Requirements</a> and Heydon Pickering's <a href="https://github.com/Heydon/inclusive-design-checklist">Inclusive Web Design Checklist</a>. I thought I'd read through them and make notes!</p>

    <h3>1. Roselli's Checklist</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>New word alert: i18n is a numeronym for 'internationalization.' Writing modes are included for when text has a vertical orientation. Roselli recommends CSS logial properties in 2020, is this still relevant? Reading through <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_logical_properties_and_values/Basic_concepts_of_logical_properties_and_values">the MDN web docs for logical properties,</a> this is so cool! It seems like a lot, can this be added to the body property? How does actually incorporating this look? I wonder if there's a write-up explaining how to provide support with this technique. Or maybe a pattern I can reference? Adrian has <a href="https://adrianroselli.com/2019/11/css-logical-properties.html">CSS logical properties guide</a>!</li>
      <li>Big takeaways from the logical properties guide: inline is the text plane, block refers to the opposite axis. Use start and end in place of left and right. Offer support for browsers that don't support it. (Would progressive enhancement be the right term to use here?)</li>
      <li>Leans on defaults: in other words, replicate expected behaviour from semantic html elements.</li>
      <li>Another tangent by looking at <a href="https://adrianroselli.com/2017/02/avoid-default-browser-focus-styles.html">avoid default browser focus styles,</a> another Roselli article. This is actually very good to know. I have not been testing with browsers outside Chromium and Firefox ESR, who both have decent default focus indicators. I actually generally prefer the Firefox default style (still in my Keyboard era) because the sites I browse have the focus overriden by people who clearly do not care about focus visibility. I didn't know that on older browsers, the focus indicator was that bad!</li>
      <li>Good to see WHCM and colour scheme and reduced motion preferences all listed together. I've been seeing each of them mentioned separately but I've never seen them all grouped together as a 'kind' of thing to check for.</li>
      <li>Also didn't know to check if Zoom is suppressed. I didn't know this was a problem, Firefix ESR overrides this setting.</li>
      <li>Print styles!!!</li>
      <li>How do we check that a site doesn't override user font settings?</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Interlude #1</h3>
    <p>So I just set my focus styles on my site to be a nice contrasty orange box. Not sure why I chose orange but Orange Shirt Day is upcoming, so maybe that's why? I also got curious abouut titles. I was under the impression that titles are just the name of the site, but actually they should reference the specific page. Makes sense. Dunno why I thought otherwise. I'm looking at <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Techniques/general/G127">Technique G127</a>, but is there any best practice guide that is more specific?</p>

    <p>Jackpot. A best practice guide for title by Amber Hinds titled <a href="https://theadminbar.com/accessibility-weekly/every-page-needs-a-meaningful-and-accurate-title/">Every Page Needs a Meaningful and Accurate Title</a> and it looks like it knows what it is talking about. I love this article, it's so specific! Big Takeaways: need to avoid duplicate titles. I also need to include the website name, and an emdash is an acceptable solution to tier them. I never even thought that this would be an important consideration for results appearing in the 'history' tab. I feel empowered to set proper title attributes for everything in my site! I really should do this across all the sites I author content for.</p>

    <h3>Interlude #2</h3>
    <p>I was checking a site for contrast and was looking at the APCA, because Seirdy recommended it. I looked through the slack for more guidance, backread the logs, and then concluded by reading Eric Eggert's entry, <a href="https://yatil.net/blog/wcag-3-is-not-ready-yet#so-should-you-use-apca">WCAG 3 is not ready yet</a>. WCAG 2 contrast does need to be reworked. What is the best way it should be reworked? I think Eric makes some very good points and critiques of APCA rollout. In an ideal world, way more resources would be dedicated to W3C and to a11y research so that this area can be researched more. Even the APCA guy admits, that there needs to be so, so much more research. But in the meantime, I'll try to make my site support a dark mode that has enough luminescence so that the content is perceivable.</p>

    <h3>2. Heydon's Checklist</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>New world alert: terse. Seems to be another word for lili pona. </li>
      <li>New word: raster. It is the opposite of vectorized.</li>
      <li>16px is the default text size. New knowledge.</li>
      <li>What the hell is a service worker?</li>
      <li>Need to learn more about what media queries are in general.</li>
      <li>Lazy loading is named here as a positive, still have in mind Seirdy's suggestion for lazy rendering. I have no idea how to implement any of them so I don't know what the point is.</li>
      <li>Need to put everything in landmark elements.</li>
      <li>I figured the whole 'pure white or pure black shades' was a thing. I think it has to due with the pure white being a bit intense. Need to get around to fully investigating the rationale.</li>
      <li>Textual labels. This is labels that you can see. For voice activation. Makes sense.</li>
      <li>Print stylesheets aren't in the WCAG, right?</li>

    </ul>

    <h2 id="note-12">What Skills? (Scrap)</h2>
    <p>Noted September 25, 2024</p>

    <p>Up until this point my notetaking sessions on this blog have been pretty thematic, but this actually doesn't capture the process that I've been taking these days of staring at the A11Y Slack and delving into various article that link to these articles and those articles. I've not made notes on a lot of those articles that I scanned. I want to take two steps back today and actually focus on a strategy for learning going forward.</p>
    <p>I need to do more case studies. I also need to take a skill-build approach. Here's some skills that would be nice to just have, taken from Donna Bunguard's presentation <a href="https://youtu.be/i4iVndHHDFk?list=PLn7dsvRdQEfFompoGO_CE5z-_HjEdgVit&t=557">The Myth of the Accessibility Unicorn</a>.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Screen reader proficiency.</li>
      <li>Mobile accessibility testing.</li>
      <li>Automated testing tools.</li>
      <li>Test script development.</li>
      <li>Manual testing techniques.</li>
      <li>WCAG knowledge.</li>
      <li>Compliance awareness.</li>
      <li>Written communication skills.</li>
      <li>Documentation and reporting.</li>
      <li>Continuous learning.</li>
      <li>Problem-solving abilities.</li>
      <li>Accessibility advocacy.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>What doesn't feature on this list is equally notable. The approach I am taking is more centered on inclusive design than on what this list suggests. WCAG knowledge and compliannce awareness does not constitute the body of knowledge that one needs to understand the range of user experiences that might occur from different patterns. Screen reader proficiency, well which one? Mobile testing, well which one, and what kind? There's also nothing about document accessibility here. I think some basic knowledge of this is needed.</p>
    <p>It also doesn't say things like 'good html,' or 'ARIA' or Javascript. You need some familiarity with this to assess why patterns are doing what they are doing.</p>

    <p>I've been obsessed with Heydon Pickering's content recently. Here's another great idea from another one of their articles, <a href="https://24ways.org/2016/what-the-heck-is-inclusive-design/">What the Heck is Inclusive Design?</a> It reads: HTML is a toolkit for inclusion. Their stance that 'universal design' and 'inclusive design' are the same thing, except 'inclusive' is more honest, seems inaccurate from my understanding. It seems like they have two different ideological positionalities. Inclusive design feels a hell of a lot more feminist and internationalist, than the idea of universal design does. But I'm going off of vibes right now. This is not scientific evidence for anything.</p>

    <p>Maybe I need to write a skill checklist or build like a report card, or self assessment for myself. I'm saying this because my current approach is unfocused, just as is any initial hyperfixation dive.</p>

    <h2 id="note-11">Blog Notes: Adrian Roselli Edition</h2>
    <p>Noted September 24, 2024</p>
    <p>Today I'm taking some peeks around Adrian Roselli's blog, that gives a whole wealth of information. I want to read it like a textbook. My goal for this will be notes on five articles.</p>

    <p>1. <a href="https://adrianroselli.com/2023/08/progressively-enhanced-html-accordion.html">Progressively Enhanced HTML Accordion</a></p>
    <ul>
      <li>I have read through this twice now. My lack of knowledge in conditional HTML and CSS applications are making me unable to see how this works without Javascript enabled. This also makes me want to understand more about what aria-labelledby means.</li>
      <li>Still struggling to see how this accomplishes what is needed for it to be called an accordion (accord(ion)-ing to Roselli's definition of an accordion) but a secondary reference to this article offers some insight. Roselli refers to the accordion he builds in this article as "still requiring ARIA and Javascript." This utterly bamboozles me. So what does progressive enhancement mean in this case? In this case, I suppose that it means the information is all technically perceivable without the JS but the presentation is just not there. Isn't that a gap between user experiences? I am struggling to understand how this is a 'Progressively Enhanced HTML Accordion' if it just is a 'Javascript-dependent accordion that is otherwise just a set of disclosures that a person can run through.' Are these two ideas synonymous?</li>
      <li>I might be missing something here. Maybe the ARIA is doing something.</li>
      <li>There is some really advanced looking transition-y CSS here. It would be nice to know how to do this myself.</li>
      <li>Note to self: custom components design requires you to think about how it will look when the page is printed. Seirdy put a lot of emphasis into this and I though they were a little bit wack for bringing it up so often, but I suppose seeing it being considered again should make me change my mind.</li>
      <li>Fascinating that an accessible component can indeed be so user-hostile. Reminds me of Pickering's talk on simple is better. I love the quote here "This post is an attempt to at least make them equally user hostile for all users."</li>
    </ul>
    <p>2. <a href="https://adrianroselli.com/2022/06/keyboard-only-scrolling-areas.html">Keyboard-only Scrolling Areas</a></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Adrian opens by describing a contention between keyboard-only and screen reader interaction. We want to add tabindex to a scrollable element, but we end up verbose (since we now have to add a role and value).</li>
      <li>Apparently, this is not an issue in Firefox. I use Firefox, hence why I have not encountered problems with this necessarily yet. Adrian also suggests enabling caret browsing to get around this issue in browsers that aren't Firefox.</li>
      <li>Reading through the saga of getting Chrome to support this feature makes me horrified. I didn't know that FAANG companies can just lie about their update logs. That seeme like that shouldn't be allowed. Also Apple being absent is... not surprising?</li>
      <li>Major takeaway: try to not have scrolling areas. If you do, set tabindex to -1 and include proper roles and labels, writhe that you can't limit the verbosity for screen reader users, and mald at Apple for not listening to Adrian Roselli.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>3. <a href="https://adrianroselli.com/2020/04/avoid-aria-roledescription.html">Avoid aria-roledescription</a></p>
    <ul>
      <li>There is basically no usecase for aria-roledescription. Don't use it to offer hints. Don't use it for the thing it is supposed to do. It just overrides the original role and language-locks it. Don't use it to standardize a user experience across screen reader users.</li>
      <li>There are <em>some</em> use cases but be incredibly thoughtful about it and keep into consideration the localization factor.</li>
      <li><a href="https://html5accessibility.com/stuff/2020/10/06/micro-note-on-aria-roledescription/">Micro-note on aria-roledescription</a>, linked to be Adrien, is hilarious. Sidenote: I am finding a11y memes incredibly comforting and motivating as I slog through this learning journey.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>4. <a href="https://adrianroselli.com/2019/10/stop-giving-control-hints-to-screen-readers.html">Stop giving control hints to screen reeaders</a></p>
    <ul>
      <li>The WCAG doesn't ask us to put in these descriptions and I am reminded of Hayden Pickering's You will NEVER know your users talk here.</li>
      <li>The videos here are very, very illustrative. The verbosity and redundancy is actually ridiculous.</li>
      <li>Helpful link to a repo recording how different elements and controls are announced by different screen reader/browser combos, <a href="https://russmaxdesign.github.io/accessible-forms/">HTML test cases</a>, and it has VoiceOver, NVDA and JAWS (no orca or talkback, but those are two I currently use primarily for testing so I suppose it works out?)</li>
    </ul>

    <p>5. <a href="https://adrianroselli.com/2014/11/dont-use-tabindex-greater-than-0.html">Don't use Tabindex Greater than 0</a></p>
    <ul>
      <li>I first learned about this in a TPGI presentation, but it will be nice to examine it in detail.</li>
      <li>This turned out to be a post about the inaccessibility of captcha. I'm not surprised. It's a cognitive test, most of them. I want to know more about how it fails WCAG standards though, that sounds spicy.</li>
      <li>Good that HTML5 now warns about using positive tab index.</li>
      <li>I should know more about the shadow dom.</li>
      <li>New word alert: anti-pattern.</li>

    <h2 id="note-10">Day Two of Keyboard Only</h2>
    <p>Noted September 22, 2024</p>

    <p>I didn't think I'd come up with another entry on this so early on in the process. I intend to experiment with Keyboard-only for at least the next week, maybe even beyond. I type an embarassing amount of search queries ending with 'keyboard shortcut' into Firefox. I often forget about how to do the things. It's obvious that the learning curve is great.</p>

    <p>But this entry isn't about complaining about the learning curve. It's about the fact that so many of the applications that I want to use are no longer accessible to me. Yesterday, I mentioned that I can't share my screen without at least one manual touch on my laptop screen. Today I found that Roll20 (used for Dungeons and Dragons) and Colonist (a Catan spoof) both have no support for Keyboard-only users.</p>

    <p>It was naive of me to think that both of these platforms which are international in nature and very dear to me, would have this kind of support. I think I was operating under some kind of idea that all the websites of companies local to me were inaccessible and/or had little keyboard support because my area is a bit of a brain drain. But Roll20? That should've been a no brainer. I was so naive. The site is unusable.</p>

    <p>There are a few keyboard traps that I've had to navigate out of. F6 is helpful, but surely there are more sophisticated techniques. I use Ctrl+F Esc+Enter a lot to get to links that I can't otherwise get to. That is certainly new information. I now better understand what the P2: Workaround available was describing in <a href="note-6">this earlier post</a>.</p>

    <p>I do get angry when it isn't accessible. I don't know that I necessarily have the right: I can enable my touchpad at any time, and my screen is a touchscreen. I want to meet people who actually use this approach with their tech. I haven't yet found a blogger that is a Keyboard-only user speaker on A11y issues. I should do that as soon as possible.</p>

    <h2 id="note-9">Concerning Focus Indicators</h2>
    <p>Noted September 21, 2024</p>

    <p>Failure descriptions for a non-visible focus indicator are described twice in the WCAG 2.1 documentation: <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Techniques/failures/F55">Technique F55</a> and <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Techniques/failures/F78">Technique F78</a>. Technique F55 deals with a situation where the focus comes onto the element, and then is removed for whatever reason. Technique F78 deals with styling that leaves the focus indicator invisible, for whatever reason.</p>

    <p>I do like a consistent looking focus indicator. I don't like it when it changes forms on me. But that's just a personal preference. It's good to know that a consistent indicator isn't actually prescribed according to WCAG.</p>

    <p>But what even causes things to not be able to be tabbed onto?</p>

    <h2 id="note-8">Entering my Keyboard-only Era</h2>
    <p>Noted September 21, 2024</p>

    <p>I just disabled the touchpad on my device. I still have the potential to cheat (my laptop is a convertible and has a touchscreen). But it seems like a good idea to become fluent in a variety of different kinds of interactions with devices. Keyboard-only with site seems like an ideal first pass.</p>

    <p>My first anxiety: I don't know how to open new applications! I have VSCodium open, Firefox with some tabs open. How do I open a new application? </p>

    <p>I'm using KDE Plasma, so I'm looking at this video titled <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5PzIbOTP50">Challenge: KDE Plasma only using Keyboard!</a> The YouTuber here is struggling to access stuff in the bottom right of the screen. This video isn't really a tutorial but a proof of concept, so let's just go to the <a href="https://docs.kde.org/stable5/en/khelpcenter/fundamentals/kbd.html">KDE Documentation</a>. I have now learned about the Meta key. I can open new apps with ease!</p>

    <p>Holy shit we managed to navigate to the panel using Meta+Alt+P! This means I can use the custom power consumption program that I would have literally no way to navigate to otherwise!</p>

    <p>Next task: adjust the spacing. Currently my windows are split right down the middle, I want to adjust the split in my screen to the left.</p>

    <p>I have my System Settings Shortcuts up and am looking at the shortcuts associated with KWin, the Windows manager. There is a thing to 'edit' the tiles, but it doesn't seem to accomplish what I want it to accomplish.</p>

    <p>Unfortunately, I'm having a lot of fun. But Keyboard-only breaks frequently on KDE. I have to go back and forth just to get focus back, it seems. But I have resized my tiles, successfuly! It just requires Alt+F3, tabbing to 'resize.' Perfect!</p>

    <p>I have also discovered caret browsing. I am dying here, this is so amazing! I can now select text just by shifting, after enabling F7 of course! Good stuff! I also want to know how to do it without caret browsing, by using a combination of Ctrl+F and pressing the Esc key. Afterwards, things can be selected via Ctrl+shift and arrow key navigation. </p>

    <p>I do appreciate all of the little hints that Google gives me. Activating Discord is also pretty daunting. I am curious to see how much I really can do with just a keyboard. So far, the only thing I truly found myself unable to do was streaming to Discord. The windows selection app by KDE, called 'Portal,' didn't let me tab to select which part of my screen I wanted to share. I'm going to try a couple more times, I might just have to mess around with it a little.</p> 
    
    <p>I took a screenshot of the issue and was trying to edit it using the file viewer in KDE called 'Glenview.' Unfortunately, I'm locked to the bottom left corner of the Glenview application and can only increase and decrease the zoom on the photo. I can't access the editing tools.</p>

    <p>I'm not surprised that it is KDE features that seem to have the least support. I already know what a nightmare Orca is, so it is unsurprising that this is also not so user friendly. Hold on a minute, I have just found a work-around for screenshot cropping. It turns out the screenshotter does have some support, so let's get this arranged.</p>

    <p>The file manager, Dolphin, is not so intuitive either. Perhaps I'll table this and attempt to put the screenshot in tomorrow.</p>

    <p>I've somehow messed up my windows proportions and now they aren't tiling correctly. Alas, the learning curve!  </p>

    <p>Noted September 20, 2024</p>

    <p>Most people who go through something like the hundred days of A11Y or who take on careers as consultants take on the full CPWA: First starting with the CPACC, and then going in on the WAS.</p>

    <p>I do think the CPACC will be worth getting within the next year, and maybe I ought to start targeting preparation at that. There is only one other person in my city that has CPACC. I also don't think CPACC will be very difficult to get. I have covered a lot of these kinds of things in my previous positions. But I do have some hestitation.</p>

    <p>Part of me is already disillusioned, based on Adrian's post <a href="https://adrianroselli.com/2024/01/under-supported-and-underpaid.html">lamenting the state of a11y professionals</a> and specifically calling out IAAP for catering to overlay companies. This does make me want to not give money to them. There is also <a href="https://www.craigabbott.co.uk/blog/stop-trying-to-recruit-unicorns-with-acorns/">Craig on the exclusionary nature of pushing the IAAP as a given</a>.

    <h2 id="note-6">First pass at a Tier List</h2>
    <p>Noted September 20, 2024</p>

    
    <p>I'm taking inspiration from my notes on Eric's blog yesterday to note down or hierarchize what accessibility failures are of first and ultimate priority. Eric offered four criteria to start with: Pause Stop Hide, Three-Flashed Threshold, Audio Control, and Keyboard Trap.</p>

    <h3>Framework 1: Five Priority Levels by Intuit</h3>

    <p>After a bit of scrounging around on Google, I've found this source by Intuit that lays out 5 tiers of priorities, titled <a href="https://blogs.intuit.com/2020/05/19/setting-priorities-for-accessibility-issues/">Setting priorities for accessibility issues.</a> Here's what their system looks like:</p>
    <dl>
      <dt>P0: Non-interference requirements</dt>
      <dd>This level cites the four same criteria that Eric sites. This can totally break the user experience and is the most likely to complete obstruct user flow. Major legal concern.</dd>
      <dt>P1: Interference/impossible to use</dt>
      <dd>This tier also encompasses critical failures that are not covered by those four non-interference as cited directly by the WCAG. This includes custom elements and accessible names (non-perceivable) that interfere with user flows. Major legal concern.</dd>
      <dt>P2: Workaround available</dt>
      <dd>This level describes instances where the user can still manage to get through the user flow by deducing the surrounding information, or using sophisticated keyboard control to break through a 'soft keyboard trap.' It's where there's clearly a barrier there and it *should* for all accounts and purposes, be considered broken code. Yet there is just enough stuff going on around that the product is still usable, by the hair on one's chinny chin chin.</dd>
      <dt>P3: Tedious/Annoying</dt>
      <dd>Lisa puts things in this category like broken Skip to Main Content links, redundant information, custom components that require a bit more extra thinking to use than if the semantic equivelant was used. I know the author's intention here and I see the caveat s they put in the desciption. But hell, Skip to Main Content can be very, very tedious for switch control users. And I'm already seeing an instance where the Skip to Main completely obscures information from the screen reader user.</dd>
      <dt>P4: Non-Barriers</dt>
      <dd>This describes things that either fail the guidelines but don't actually interfere with any user flows (the example here is given for improper labling of elements that are actually never interacted with by the user) or instances that take away from what would be best practices.</dd>
    </dl> 
    <p>Lisa Rathjens, the author of this post, gives plenty of caveats while outlining this framework. I've also inserted some of my issues with it. It's incredibly pragmatic and does not at all lean on best practices accessibility, or digital accessibility that falls beyond WCAG's scope. But I think it can be adapted to fit a more best-practice centered-model. This is a good start, I'm curious to see what else is out there.</p>

    <h3>Framework 2: An A11Y Issue Prioritization Matrix</h3>
    <p>The author of <a href="https://www.hassellinclusion.com/blog/accessibilitys-goal-is-to-fix-issues-not-just-find-them/">this prioritization tool</a> talks in terms of cost-benefit analysis and project management, so I can already tell that this framework is not going to sit as well with me as Lisa Rathjens' framework. But also, the audience of this tools appears to be slightly different.</p>
    <p>This matrix is proposed as a communication tool to motivate project managers and the people actually doing to remediation to feel that the work is worth pursuing. I struggle with this framing because accessibility should be considered a baseline and these arguments run counter to creating a larger culture that considers disabled clients to be as worthy of reaching out to as any other client. But I also understand that the BBAs and BAs live in two separate worlds, right now. Enough of this tangent. Let's look at the four scales that the matrix ranks against:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Extent/Frequency of occurence. How many pages within the website does it impact, is it present at key user flows?</li>
      <li>Size of audience impacted. I don't like this one, not going to lie.</li>
      <li>Impact of the issue. This is equivelant to non-interference/interference/workaround/tedious, except this framework only lists the levels of 'high, medium, and low.'</li>
      <li>Estimated cost. Also don't like this one.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>The matrix then creates two values: Value for money, and Political Risk Aversion, by multiplying different values across these four matrices.</p>
    <p>I actually don't have a lot of good things to say about this framework, the word choice here is unfortunately too pragmatic for me. It doesn't think enough about impact and it wants me to not prioritize issues that only a minority of users are going to encounter. Reading this over, it seems like it runs counter to the principles of inclusive design. Additionally, best practices seem to not feature at all in here.</p>

    <h3>Framework 3: Deque's Stragic Planning tool for Accessibility Prioritization</h3>

    <p>This framework is from 2016 and is hosted directly on Deque's blog, authored by Glenda Sims. It is directly addressed to clients of digital accessibility consultants, and to project managers. So it has some of the same framing problems that I brought up in the second framework I analysed.</p>

    <p>This is also set up as a map, but this one has two axis. Front and center in the chart is 'User Impact.' This is a relief to see. One big departure from the other prioritization matrix is that it emphasizes that number of users impacted doesn't not really matter when it comes to factoring in litigation risk. A single user can issue a lawsuit. In this framing, user impact specifically refers to the amount of interference that it can potentially bring on a single user. The second axis of the chart is 'Litigation risk' and refers directly to the law. Unsure about how this can be fully separate from User Impact: most lawsuits need to have some form of User Impact situation happening in order for a lawsuit to even be brought to relevancy.</p>

    <p>Two additional factors play a smaller role, but actually aren't positioned on the chart. They are annotated in the margins: Product Lifecycle and Remediation Cost. I like that these instances are not considered front and center, but they are included for pragmatism. The consideration of the product's lifecycle is new to me: It makes sense to not fix something that has plans to be retired anyway. It is also easier to catch things that are younger in the lifecycle, that are in the first stages of development (shifting left).</p>

    <h3>
      Closing Thoughts
    </h3>
    <p>I didn't end up drafting a tier list today. The biggest takeaway I have from this small dive is that it is better to assess against user flows than outright declare some WCAG criteria to be more universally of higher priority than others, with the exception of the four non-interference criteria. Additionally, I learned that supporting my client through articulating the priority of certain issues is essential to making my advice actually getting implemented. It is an essential communication tool, and will be very valuable in high-volume projects.</p>

    <p>This whole discussion also brings up a larger question: How do we get companies and web devs to bring in best practices outside of WCAG and to care about things without really zooming in on the legal issues?</p>

    <h2 id="note-5">New info from Eric Eggert's Blog</h2>
    <p>Noted September 19, 2024</p>

    <p>I'm going to be jumping around Eric's website today making some brief notes on a selection of his articles.</p>

    <p>1. <a href="https://yatil.net/blog/wcags-a-and-aa-distinction-is-mostly-academic">WCAG A and AA distinction mostly academic</a></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Generally, this piece advocates for WCAG conformance reform.</li>
      <li>Reminds me of the high-urgency framework I read elsewhere: some SC truly matter more than others. Some make the thing completely unusable: Eric points these out as Audio Control, No Keyboard Trap, Three Flashes or Below Threshold, and Pause, Stop, Hide.</li>
      <li>He makes a really good point on how 1.2.5 Audio Description prerecorded is seriously weird at Level AA. Descriptive transcripts are a million times more feasible for content authors to make than Audio Description. Audio Description is great, but is extremely costly when it must be part of remedial solutions, and many orgs who do supply Audio Description do not ever have one user that makes use of it.</li>
      <li>It feels like Audio Description would be more fitting as how Sign Language interpretation is currently set out. I do think they are very similar kinds of problems, though I am unaware with all the politicking and background that made Audio Description AA in the first place.</li>
      <li>Eric's description of A as "removes many barriers for many disabled people," AA as "removes most barriers for most disabled people" and AAA as "removes additional barriers" is a good communication tool I want to deploy in the future. But also understanding some of that nuance, as well as where the formal legal structure of 'COMPY OR DIE' seems to fail. Lawsuits, as far as I understand, are aimed at specific user flows failing. And if a descriptive text transcipt is there, that user flow can still be executed. I don't see the problem otherwise.</li>
      </ul>
    <p>2. <a href="https://yatil.net/blog/the-infuriating-inefficiency-of-accessibility-audits">The infuriating inefficiency of accessibility audits</a></p>
    <ul>
      <li>One thing I have been seriously nervous about within breaking into this field is my lack of technical knowledge. Just look at this website. I write these blog posts in HTML. I would prefer to do it in markdown, but I don't know how to set up the jekyll files. I am not a software engineer: I am a critic, trained in literary crticism and textual criticism, with a healthy sample of knowing academic theories about inclusion, anti-racism, and disability justice. This article emphasizes that one doesn't need to do the work of remediation: direct that to the team who made the website. I am merely an auditor. The auditor does not go in a rip apart the bricks of the house themself. I read this article to myself and think: the tech knowledge will come. I will learn what I need to learn, the jargon I need to know, to communicate effectively and provide solutions to my clients.</li>
      <li>Eggert recommends teams to try tackling accessibility on their own using automated testing before reaching out with an accessibility consultant. Get some baseline knowledge, and learn the questions you'll need to ask. I wonder how I can support my clients to take the reigns into their own hands like this.</li>
      <li>More talking about shifting left. We need to think about a11y prior to launch. The team needs to have a toolkit in mind. It's.. kinda wild that most university settings and coding bootcamps offer very little when it comes to a11y. I'm literally not even a web developer, and I know more than you. Ridiculous! I'm thinking back to the web developer that worked with my first organization. They promised us an accessible product in their contract. This should not be acceptable at all.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>3. <a href="https://yatil.net/blog/hope-kills-you">It's the hope that kills you</a></p>
    <ul>
      <li>I've been reading a lot of articles about burnout within a11y as a field, and this is certainly not the first that mentions Mike Paciello, a once respected subject matter expert, joining a cushy position at AudioEye. They promote an overlay and they use SLAPP lawsuit to silence people who disagree with them.</li>
      <li>I have experience with burnout. I read this article and think to myself: in truth, I am a pessimist when it comes to systemic change. All of the activists that I have looked up know that the system we are all trying to build will not be enjoyed by us, but by our children, our descendents. But yet I still dream of change. Just, with very low actual expectations for what these outcomes are.</li>
      <li>Organizing is always a one step forward, two steps back orddeal. Reading Eric's article over, I sense the optism and excitement that he describes in the early years of the field, as well as that sinking feeling that capitalism is poaching and corrupting the intentions of people who started 'good.' Money is such a big deal. This is why we need more Disabled users to be our CEOs, to be subject matter experts. The state of the field is not like that right now, and Eric's comment about abled people profitting from issues facing the Disabled community is very on the ball. It almost feels like a matter analagous to the financial arguments made for restricting cultural appropriation. It also mirrors what the Deaf community says to hearing people who want to teach signed languages: Don't freaking do it. It's not yours, you don't rely on it.</li>

    <h2 id="note-4">New info from Seirdy's Best Practices 2/2</h2>
    <p>Noted September 19, 2024</p>

    <h3>On Optimization</h3>

    <p>Starting at the 'Long-page performance' section in <a href="https://seirdy.one/posts/2020/11/23/website-best-practices/#long-page-performance">Seirdy's Best Practices blog post.</a>
    
    <h4>The 'decoding' attribute</h4>

    <p>The 'decoding attribute' is proposed as an alternative to lazy loading. Last time, we learned lazy loading was not inclusive because it doesn't work well with users with poor connections, it is also disabled by some browsers. It's also a 'fingerprinting vector,' and I don't know what that means but it sounds scary. The decoding attribute only targets images. Seirdy doesn't really exploain the technicalities of why decoding is good, while lazy loading is bad. I think it lies on the network level: lazy loading actually defers networks requests, which decoding seems to have a similar effect without actually interfering with network requests themselves.</p>

    <h4>The CSS attribute 'contain'</h4>

    <p>Time to learn about CSS containment! Seirdy doesn't give me much, so I'm looking outside to other sources.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_containment/Using_CSS_containment">Documentation from Mozilla MDN</a>. It seems this article is slightly old? The next article specifies that 'strict' and 'style' have been deprecated due to lack of scope.</li>
      <li><a href="https://blogs.igalia.com/mrego/2019/01/11/an-introduction-to-css-containment/">An intoduction to CSS Containment by Rego (Igalia)</a>. In this source, the example given is really helpful. One phrasing I'm struggling to digest is 'the isolation of a subtree'but here I think 'subtree' is just a synonym for a group of elements that are related to one another somewhow, or presented as a single unit. The idea is that you bundle this up (for the computer to understand) so it can render it individually if some kind of script is applied, or some change of layout, the thing doesn't need to comb through the entire DOM to search for elements of all that class name. It only needs to target the thing that it needs to change, improving the efficiency by something like 1000% if I am correctly interpreting the numbers this example provides.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>So I understand containment, but not the property 'content-visibility.' I don't understand, if you are already using 'containment,' why would content-visibility be an issue? Here's my guess: regardless of containment, the entire DOM will be rendered through upon the first rendering of the page. 'content-visibility' will make it so that only content that is visible on the page will be rendered. This doesn't stop the entire DOM from being combed through (that would be something like "display: none;" so AT can still get access to the page's structure.It's not lazy-loading. The whole thing is, in fact, loaded. You just can't see it, so no strain is put on the GPU.</p> 
    
    <p>It's lazy-rendering.</p>
    
    <p>Seirdy notes that there is no harm in including this, it's a progressive enhancement feature. that older browsers will simply ignore. But they also include a lot of stuff about the 'contain-intinsic-size' property, which I have tried to understand and can't understand yet.</p>

    <h4>Why is Optimization an Accesibility issue?</h4>

    <p>Seirdly links to this amazing slide deck by Eric W Baily titled <a href="https://noti.st/ericwbailey/Yfyaxa/slides">the intersection of Performance and Accessibility</a>. This is a really nice deck because the slide deck itself is optional, everything you really need to know is in the accompanying speaker's notes, which really makes it feel like we're experience Eric's talk. But beyond the amazing design of the talk, the content really lays out what is at stake when it comes to optimization for accessibility reason. It comes down to understand the Accessibility Tree.</p>
    <p>Now. I had guessed that something like the accessibility tree existed under the hood. It makes sense that the there has to be a separate interface from the DOM itself that AT can interact with. The Accessibility tree is modeled from the DOM and can be viewed as a version of the DOM with all things that aren't essential to accessibility stripped off. This is for performance reasons, and it is what the AT interacts with.</p>
    <p>In this use case, Eric talks about a case they came across while editing where there was a very deep, nested tree of elements in order to create some kind of feature in 'settings' where users can select their preferences. The porblem is that each 'selection' was made with custom div elements, not semantic HTML. And each feature was something like 6 elements with 9 attributes and a DOM length of 3. With 66 CSS selectors containing 141 properties. In other words, it was a very heavy design.</p>
    <p>So what was the problem? It overloaded the parallel model that the accessibility tree was creating, and the screen reader technology crashed. It was entirely unusable for users of NVDIA/JAWS on Firefox.</p>
    <p>The fix? semantic HTML that reduced the amount of div nesting, taken from a project called <a href="https://scottaohara.github.io/a11y_styled_form_controls/">'a11y_styled_form_controls'</a> and visually indistinguishable from the original.</p>
    <p>With this small case study, we can see that performance is a consideration with accessibility. Seirdy often discusses very niche technology and AT when testing for performance, but this case study shows that even mainstream AT can get bogged down by too much Javascript.</p>

    <h2 id="note-3">Should Phone Numbers be in an Anchor Tag?</h2>
    <p>Noted September 18, 2024</p>
    <h3>Some Background</h3>
    <p>Specifically, I am curious about this question from the a11y point of view. A quick Google search has this <a href="https://core.fiu.edu/blog/2023/hyperlinking-phone-numbers.html">phone number hyperlink guide</a> that makes the argument: most of the userw who access your site are doing so on smartphones. Making the number a link improves usability: no need to copy and paste for the link. This seems like this would be good for accessibility. But before making conclusions, let's see what other sources say.</p>
    <h3>Source #1: Maybe Doesn't Know What He's Talking About</h3>
    <p>Google gave me a <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/cliveloseby_business-webdesign-diversity-activity-7174045480148987904-fUJt?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop">LinkedIn post that you shouldn't read</a> talking about putting an ARIA label on a phone number so that the screen reader would 'pronounce it properly' with the three digits, pause, three digits, pause, four digits. Some people in the bottom make some good arguments against this: This will not provide a ubiquitous experience around different forms of AT and already makes a unwieldly intervention on something that screen reader software and users know about and are equipped to deal with. Users can read character by character and control their own speed!. Particularly, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/matthew-putland/?originalSubdomain=au">Matthew Putland</a> pointed out that it would actually detract from the experience of braille display users of screen readers due to the way that braille itself adds number characters before numbers. Seems like this is an instance of no aria is better than bad aria, as they always say!</p> 
    <p>But this actually doesn't answer my question. What about anchor links? what about other ways we can make phone numbers accessible?</p>
    <h3>Source #2: TPGI</h3>
    <p><a href="https://www.tpgi.com/making-numbers-in-web-content-accessible/">TPGi's article</a> offers a collection of really helpful tips. They concur with Matthew Putland's assessment that aria labels should not be used to override screen reader users' preference. Also they provide a clear answer to my question: Yes! You should add an anchor element, and you should use the tel: prefix to your code.</p>
    <h3>Source #3: WCAG Supplemental</h3>
    <p>I found a note in the <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG2/supplemental/patterns/o3p06-format-punctuation/">Cognitive Accesibility note in WCAG supplementals</a> simply saying to format in number in the way your locale typically desingates phone numbers. This improves the readability for cognitively disabled folks, and improves readibility for text-to-speech voices (this is a bold claim-- where is your evidence)?</p>
    <h3>Source #4: ADA Site Compliance</h3>
    <p>We're beyond the discussion of anchor elements at this point, but while we're talking about different disability-technology interactions, here's another point that <a href="https://adasitecompliance.com/website-accessibility-for-deaf-and-hard-of-hearing/">ADA Site Compliance</a> makes: Don't only have a phone number listed in your contacts. Some people don't want to use the phone! The article lists Deaf/Hard-of-Hearing/late-deafened people as the target for such an intervention, but I can list so many more. Social anxiety! Those who can't use their voice! People who have trouble articulating sounds well! Auditory processing disorders! I can't understate social anxiety! This is a super great, and perhaps only tacitly related point, but it's an important one.</p>

    <h3>In Summary</h3>
    <p>I was worried that anchored telephone numbers would be distracting to people using things like JAWS, NVDIA, and Talk-Back. I saw no accounts of such a phenomenon, but learned some other key things instead:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Don't put an ARIA label on a phone number.</li>
      <li>Make sure to format it to your locale's standard formatting.</li>
      <li>Don't forget the 'tel' prefix in your href!</li>
      <li>Ensure you have alternative ways for clients to contact you besides just the phone number.</li>
    </ul>

      Concerning PDFs
    </h2>
    <p>Noted September 18, 2024</p>
    <p>I currently know very little about nearly all aspects of PDF accessibility, so today I will ask a question to myself and answer it.</p>
    <dl>
      <dt>Under legislated WCAG 2.1 and under the AMA, is it required to have all PDF documents acceptable? For example: would it be enough to simply indicate that plain-text versions of the PDF are available? Would a plaintext document be considered a replacement for this?</dt>
      <dd>Preliminarily, ChatGPT tells me the company is liable. What about links to external PDFs, where is the line drawn? Time to read <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG-TECHS/pdf.html">PDF techniques from W3C</a>. Apparently something called PDF/UA, guidelines released in 2012, is applicable here? Now taking a look at this <a href="https://boutonjones.com/pub/a11y/a11y_accessu_2024_pdf101_handout.pdf">slide deck from a subject matter expert</a>. Ironically it's a PDF. Key takeaways from this: in America, inaccessible PDFs have been the subject of Section 508 lawsuits. Additionally, 'tagged PDFs' are considered the only PDFs with the potential to be accessible.</dd>
      </dt>
    </dl>
    <p><a href="https://boutonjones.com/pub/a11y/a11y_accessu_2024_pdf101_handout.pdf">The PDF slide deck</a> is a goldmine. Here's another thing to learn: if you 'Print to PDF' (as I often DO!) the resulting product will be stripped of all semantic markup, all tags, with the weird exception of tables. It makes sense, table behaviour can never not be weird.</p>
    <p>More gems from the slide deck:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Microsoft Word, you will have to manually select the document language in order for that to be in the markup. I wonder if this would have progressed at ALL with the development of some of these interfaces. It seems reasonable that this can be done automatically. What is to be done with billingual documents? Unsure if there is the availability to but lang attributes on different sections within most word processors.</li>
      <li>Table of contents are highly recommended. They can be generated automatically if you already have semantic markup and I do do this frequently. However: I am curious about the styling. The very common Table of Contents styles has a lot of leading periods before the page number. This doesn't seem screen-reader friendly. Maybe it generates it automatically with ARIA that ignores it? Do PDFs have ARIA? Googling has no good answer to this.</li>
      <li>Another advice is not to use tables for layout. Okay. Then how? Also, I am pretty sure that the PDF that initially triggered this whole fiasco for me was created in Microsoft Publisher. Are they even publishing publisher? Has Publisher been unpublished?</li>
      <li>For data, column headers in tables are apparently a nightmare.</li>
      <li>In popular word processors, if alt text is left blank, is it marked as decorative or will it lack the alt attribute? I will need to test this by myself maybe.</li>
      <li>Word art and text boxes are not accessible, apparently. Why aren't text boxes accessible?</li>
      <li>Additionally. Did AI change the landscape on PDF accessibility? Not that it matters truly-- many users will not have access to AI and we have to cater to the most janky setup to priotize truly inclusive design. </li>
      <li>A major take-away from this slide deck is that working within the word processor is a million times better than taking a pdf and trying to remediate it using Acrobat. I do not even have acrobat. My clients will likely not have it either, nor have the technical expertise to do this write! It is easy enough to teach how to do semantic markup. Again, it's always about building a culture of accessibility-- and remediation seems like the solution that just accepts innaccessible production as a given.</li>
      <li>New topic: bookmarks. Bookmarks should mirror headings (are they just another form of semantic markup?) In word we can do this on exprt by saying 'create bookmarks using headings' (I wonder what the Doc equivelant is...)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Bouton emphasizes that we should be first asking the question: is a PDF the best way to accomplish what we need?</p>
    <h3>Personal Reflection</h3>
    <p>I am thinking back to the time I spent at my former workplace and the amount of PDFs that we generated on a daily basis to throw up on our website. We did it so much and I'm sure we're not alone.</p>
    <p>I don't know why I though PDFs were exempt from WCAG. It's obvious in hindsight. I think I didn't know enough about PDFs to understand even the beginning of how they can be made accessible. But it comes down to semantic markup, as it always does. I shouldn't be surprised.</p>
    <p>I need to get into the habit of making accessible PDFs in my personal life as well.</p>
    <p>Ironically, I often read PDFs with a text-to-speech engine. And I understand where all the bullshit comes in, I've just never considered that there might be fixes to this. If only all the headers were marked, semantically as headers!</p>
    <p>Another big consideration here is that a lot of PDF content I read are scans of content, or instances where the PDF was not meant to be consumed on a device.A lot of this content is done by volunteers who are simply going for quantity over quality. But there are bigger problems that those specific sites have to worry about, legally, than accessibility lawsuits.</p>

    <h2 id="note-1">New info from Seirdy's Best Practices 1/2</h2>
    <p>Noted around September 16, 2024</p>
    <p><a href="https://seirdy.one/posts/2020/11/23/website-best-practices/">Seirdy's Best Practices guide</a> is the blog post in question.</p>
    <p>'Maximally inclusive' as catering to the edge case, niche browsers, old browsers. What possible kinds of users are there? Inclusivity goes beyond accessibility: language barriers, class barriers.</p>
    <p>Questions about things I don't understand:</p>
    <dl>
      <dt>What is TLS?</dt>
      <dd>According to Wikipedia, it stands for Transport Layer Security and it secures the HTTP protocol. I need to ask about the scope of this one is in particular, I know very little about cybersecurity.</dd>

      <dt>When Seirdy talks about not relying on scripts, are they talking about literally all Javascript? Probably...</dt>
      <dd>According to Copilot, Seirdy's referring to client-side scripts, which is basically just Javascript. PHP doesn't count because it's server-side. As for what popular things rely on scripts, dynamic content loading, animations, interactive forms, real-time updates, media controls, and e-commmerce things are all Javascript things.</dd>

      <dt>What does the cache have?</dt>
      <dd>A cache is a folder held in your version of the browser you are using. It stores it in there to allow faster reloaded of key assets. I didn't understand how it could be stored 'on the device' before-- but it does this by storing in itself. How does Firefox get stored on your computer? Firefox's cache is in the same folder.</dd>


      <dt>What does it mean to be a 'blocking' resource?</dt>
      <dd>A resource that can cause the website to be blank, even if most things get loaded correctly. A blocked resource effectively makes it so that this doesn't mean anything. </dd>


      <dt>What is 'semantically-meaningful compressed markup?</dt>
      <dd>Googling this combination of words only brings up Seirdy's article. </dd>

      <dt>What is 'lazy loading?'</dt>
      <dd>When the page loads things only as needed. This is most used for pages that have lots of javascript.</dd>

      <dt>What is 'infinite scolling?'</dt>
      <dd>So this is when the content comes from the bottom endlessly. Like TikTok! Actually not like TikTok, but this is how I'll be thinking about it. Particularly, it makes footers difficult to reach for AT users.</dd>
    </dl>
    <p>Seirdy makes a great point that an overloaded CPU means that speech synthesis might be thin. I expect it's similar for voice-controlled contol, eye-control (like with a Tobi). They make a lot of hemming and hawing about the importance of quick and efficient asset loading and I don't think I appreciated this section until they made that comment. In this case, ease of loading is an inclusivity issue.</p>

    <p>Seirdy talks a lot about 'user flows' as being a more accurate framework than 'page weight.' But I want to learn about the latter before appreciating the former, so let's go on a-- it's REALLY JUST the AMOUNT OF BYTES??!??!</p>

    <p>Page weight is considered a speed metric, maybe. But Seirdy's framing puts these bytes into context (user interaction and goal). I wonder why bytes wouldn't be a good assesment, aren't bytes bytes? </p>
