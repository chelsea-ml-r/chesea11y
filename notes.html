      <h2 id="note-48">CPACC Study Day 2/2: Disability Types</h2>
      <p>Noted Thursday, November 14, 2024</p>
  
      <p>Starting off today by giving my website's CSS facelift. Oof. The redesign's colours do NOT look good, but at least the dark mode is way more respectable than before. I've used a bunch of 'variables' to manage colour, and organized the actual layout of the CSS document better. I still need to rework the reflow, but it's a good start.</p>
      <p>Now that I've wasted an hour and fifteen minutes on that, time to get into Anki memorization.</p>

      <h3>Anki Deck: Categories of Disabilities</h3>
      <p>Six types of cognitive disabilites: intellectual, reading, math, attention deficit hyperactivity, autism, non-verbal learning. Mnemonic: MARINA: math, ADHD, reading, intellectual, non-verbal learning, autism.</p>
      <p>Intellectual disabilies defined by IQ score (lower than 70-75), before the age of 18 + limitations, 1-3% of population, delayed development and slower cognitive function.</p>
      <p>Reading/dyslexia: reading ability low despite having normal intelligence; additionall difficulty with phonological processing, spelling, rapid visual-verbal responding. Causes vary wildly from the neurologic to the physical to injury. 'Dyslexia' diagnosis not applicable in all cases.</p>

      <h3>Interlude: More Blog Maintenance</h3>
      <p>I couldn't just leave the reflow bad and the colours ugly. I've fixed both, fixed the colour contrast. I just need to tackle hover and focus styles again, rework the 'Bookmarks' page, and then I'll be pretty satisfied.</p>

      <h3>Slight Change of Pace</h3>
      <p>I'm going to just read the entire Body of Knowledge today front to back to get a bird's-eye view of the situation here. This will also make the Anki deck studying more logical. </p>

      <p>Okay, I just finished up. That's a lot of content. I am 100% going to struggle the most with Domain 3. That's a lot of memorization and specific details to remember. I am newly worried about the extent to which additional reading will play a part in this. I am a bit upset that this document is only available as a PDF.</p>

      <p>In terms of a plan, it makes sense to me that I just need to set nose to grindstone. I'm going to take a small peak at Amy's work just to see the amount of time she dedicated to each section. The Body of Knowledge claims that Domain 3 consists of 20% of the exam. That's wild. It really does feel like it holds the most factual tidbits one has to memorize. Amy spent 2-3 hours a day over 45 days. If I do this for longer than that, I should be okay.</p>

      <h3>Anki Deck (continued)</h3>
      <p>Computation/Math disabilities include dyscalculia (inability to understand arithmetic or grasp the scope of numbers and logic) which 3-6% of people have and is has no set cause; it can be due to congenital, injury, aging, disease.</p>
      <p>ADHD's key symptoms are inattention, distractibility, impulsivity, and hyperactivity, affecting 11% of the population.</p>
      <p>ASD spectrum characterized by impaired social behaviour, communication, language. This definition wants us to focus on special interests, sensory issues, and echolalia alongside stunted development in early years, co-existing conditions, intellectual functioning is variable.</p>
      <p>Non-verbal learning disability is not in the DSM but is described as a condition similar to autism level one, with learning disability stemming from visuo-spatial processing limitations. <em>My commentary: It doesn't have consistent diagnostic criteria even in 2024, so I find it slightly suspect that IAAP puts it here.</em></p>

      <h2 id="note-47">CPACC Study Day 1/2: Disability Types</h2>
      <p>Noted Tuesday, November 12, 2024</p>

      <h3>Anki Deck: Categories of Disabilities</h3>
      <p>For types of disability, I've developed a mnemonic that goes with the song 'Head, Shoulders, Knees and Toes.' It goes, "Psychological, Compound, Mobility, Seizure, Mobility, Seizure, Mobility, Seizure. Cognitive, Compound, Mobility, Seizure; Visual, Auditory, Speech, Deaf-Blind." I do the actions as I say this.</p>
      <p><em>Side Note: People in my region sing "Head and Shoulders" to the tune of "London Bridge." In my opinion, this is the only way it should be done.</em></p>
      <h4>Vision</h4>
      <p>Blindness can refer to: partial blindness, low vision (can perceive light and dark and general shapes of large objects).</p>
      <p>Colour-blindness especially applies to colours that are of equal luminosity.</p>
      <p>Low-vision is a spectrum that is typically defined functionally.</p>
      <p>Visual disabilities comprise of the three above.</p>
      <h4>Auditory</h4>
      <p>Auditory disabilities are caused by genetics, prematurity, infections, ear trauma, exposure to loud noises, aging: auditory processing disorder, deafness, HOH.</p>
      <p>Deafness: 'total or near-total loss of hearing.' Some sign, some do not.</p>
      <p>HOH: 6.1% of population/466 million people, mild to severe hearing loss. Adequate assistance may be provided by AT.</p>
      <p>Central APD: 5% of global population, confused with other disorders, no hearing loss exists but difficulty understanding speech. Source of sound, distinguishing words, learning instruments, paying attention, learning new languages, responding in a timely way.</p>
      <p>Deafblindness: Prescence of deafness and blindness, leaving touch as the primary communication medium. 0.2-2% of people are DeafBlind. <strong>My commentary: there are a lot of peope who identify as DeafBlind who don't meet these descriptions. Blindness and Deafness have spectrums from Blind to low vision, Deaf to HoH. DeafBlind people can sit anywhere along those two axioms, and with that definition, I assume the prevalence listed would be higher.</strong></p>
      <h4>Speech Disabilities</h4>
      <p>There are eight types: stuttering, cluttering, apraxia, dysarthia, speech sound disorders, articulation, aphasia, and muteness (no speech). Our mnemonic will be 'Amass A CDs': aphasia, muteness, articulation, speech-sound, cluttering, apraxia, dysarthia, stuttering. Picture someone collecting a bunch of CDs only from artists whose names start with the letter A.</p> 
      <p>Articulation can be broken into three categories: speech sound, phonological process, and motor speech disorders. Characterized by adding/leaving off sounds, distorting or swapping sounds.</p>
      <p>Aphasia can affect comprehension of speech and reading/writing ability in addition to just produced speech. It results from brain injury (often a stroke), there are at least 2 million people in the US with it, and at least 250 thousand in Great Britain with it.</p>
      <p>Muteness is either neurogenic (aphasia, apraxia, disarthia) or psychogenic. Psychogenic mutism has three types: selective elective, selective non-elective, and total. 0.47-0.76 of the population has selective mutism.</p>
      <h4>Mobility, Flexibility, Body Structure</h4>
      <p>People with upper/lowe limb loss/disability, manual dexterity, difficulty cooordinating different organs of the body, and broken skeletal structure.</p>
      <p>Four subareas are manual dexterity, ambulation, muscle fatigue and body size/shape.</p>
      <p>Manual dexterity/fine motor control, requires coordination between the brain and muscles. Disability in this area can lead to handwriting issues and inability to dress independently. Can be hard to manipulate objects/use both hands at the same time. Children with ADHD have issues with this.</p>
      <p>Ambulation is the ability toe walk with or without an assistive device. Ambulation disabilities can be disease based or injury based: think cerebral palsy and back injuries. 3.5% of adults in the US have ambulatory disabilities.</p>
      <p>Muscle fatigue is associated with a bunch of causes and conditions and it's when basic tasks become very difficult. It can be in a specific part of the body and can present as soreness, twitching, trembling, cramping, and is associated with general weakness.</p>
      <p>Body size or shape disabilities affect stature, proportions or shape. Dwarfism, acromegaly, rheumatoid arthritis are some examples. This is characterized by the prescence of other co-occuring conditions.<strong> My comment: not surprising that it falls into line in presenting 'obesity' itself as a disease. As scholars of fat studies note, this is an argument with no evidence, and the prevelance of it leads to lesser health outcomes for obese patients due to misdiagnosis and mistreatment in medical settings. So I'm not surprised to see this here, and I'm not happy about it.</strong> </p>
      <h3>Palette Cleanser: Adrian Roselli on Tables</h3>
      <p>Roselli spoke about HTML tables at WebAIM, watch along with me at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaIjHF7FHv8">Talkin' Tables</a></p>
      <p>He clarifies that a caption is not a WCAG requirement, which is something I also came across recently. Scope isn't needed for simple tables (though I've come across the situation where you should add it if it is ambiguous what data is applicable to each header.) Also, your table headers must be in the first column in the DOM regardless of CSS presentation. Don't be putting them at the bottom of the table, or switching to new headers mid-table. Scope is not as important (the browser is good at figuring that out) as colspan and rowspan, theoretically. In practice, support for colgroup and rowgroup is low and incredibly variable across screen reader/browser combinations. Avoid spanning. Cell count can be affected by this, and inconsistant cell count can break navigation. Test, test, test!</p>
      <p>He talks about an over-enginnered and under-engineered pattern for making good table reflow. He says that he still 'feels bad' for relying on CSS-gennerated content. This is the pattern that Deque suggests so.. I'm curious as what Roselli thinks about that pattern now.</p>
      <p>I prefer the signing style of the second interpreter to the first one.</p>
      <p>Next we have fixed headers, both row and column. I have a hard time understanding him because I don't know what Z indexes are.</p>
      <p>Scroll snapping, Roselli rejects, citing usability concerns.</p>

      <h2 id="note-46">A New Direction</h2>
      <p>Noted Tuesday, November 12, 2024</p>

      <p>Starting my morning off with Manuel Matuzović's talk, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wno1IhEBTxc">Lost in Translation</a>.</p>

      <h3>Biting the Bullet</h3>
      <p>I've had a bit of hesitency around trying to get the CPACC certification. IAAP, the organization that backs this certification, maintains relationships with overlay shillers. The actual body of knowledge is far removed from conversations around disability justice. I don't get the impression that the IAAP truly operates under the axiom of 'nothing about us without us.' But with all that said, it's time to bite the bullet.</p>
      <p>I feel like I will gain no traction if I do not get this now.</p>
      <p>I am fortunate that I have the financial resources to pay the exorbitant exam fee.</p>

      <h3>Those Who've Tread Before</h3>
      <h4>1. <a href="https://dev.to/josefine/studying-for-cpacc-becoming-a-certified-accessibility-professional-2mh3">Josefine Schfr: Studying for CPACC | Becoming a Certified Accessibility Professional</a></h4>
      <p>What resonates for me here is that Schfr really didn't have a strong impression of how they did when they left the exam center, and it took six weeks for the results to arrive.</p>
      <p>Schfr links a few resources: the linked video by Derek Mei is what I'll be looking at next.</p>
      <h4>2. Reddit Threads</h4>
      <p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/accessibility/comments/1cwb4gj/iaap_cpacc_may_2024/">May 2024, u/Krysulia</a> posted this congregation thread of people anxiously waiting for the six-month period to let up.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/accessibility/comments/18j5ljt/passed_the_cpacc_exam_with_752/">Passed the CPACC with 752, u/TellAdministrative95</a>. This thread suggests working through all the material, then registering, and working through all the material again. This person preferred the Princeton course over Deque, but noted that some aspects were only covered in the Deque University course.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/accessibility/comments/16ftdvi/cpacc_level_of_study_required/?chainedPosts=t3_1da4fpn">CPACC: Level of Study Required? by u/ivytranfcd</a>. They provided some updates. They say the Deque course offered 'peace of mind' but didn't actually add much more material. One comment on this thread suggested using the Book of Knowledge and diving into 'further reading' as much as possible.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/accessibility/comments/11s3vj3/iaap_cpacc_exam_just_finished/?chainedPosts=t3_16ftdvi%2Ct3_1da4fpn">IAAP CPACC exam- just finished, by u/Necessary_Marzipan99</a>. This person was uh WILD and literally had TWO WEEKs to prepare. They say to focus on learning disabilities that start with d, universal design principles 2.0, and Japanese law. They were absolutely floored by the wait time for the results. Another commentor chimed in that they really felt that given that the IAAP doesn't actually assess whether a person can be a good accessibility practitioner, the fact that it is so unfriendly to neurodivergent folks is quite insidious.</p>
      <h4>3. <a href="https://youtu.be/a01vcZMTJqU">Full CPACC Study Guide by Derek Mai</a></h4>
      <p>Mai affirms that the IAAP's suggestion of 8 weeks of studying for the exam, with 5-10 hours per week was accurate.</p>

      <h3>My Strategy</h3>
      <h4>When</h4>
      <p>I have a choice to make. I can either do an exam sometime between November 13 (tomorrow!) to December 4, or I need to wait until January 22 to February 19.</p>
      <p>Now. I am very good at cramming. But December 4 is a bit much. February 19 is a bit mucher. It might be worth to just go for December 4, and then take again on February if I don't pass the first round. But simulatenously, I would rather be more confident than less confident. I can still do work in between studying for the exam, and I can still make my way through the Deque WAS courses, as I've been doing. There's no need to freak out. February will be here before I know it, and I'll have the results on April 2, 2025.</p>
      <p>That is a bit far off, however. Potentially I can also register for the Web Accessibility auditing credential at the <a href="https://continuing.torontomu.ca/search/publicCourseSearchDetails.do?method=load&courseId=26089061#courseProfileSections">Chang School at TMU</a> when the next section opens up.</p>
      <p>It appears that I've made the decision to take this on at the most inopportune time, in terms of timeline.</p>
      <h4>How</h4>
      <p>I have time so I guess we're just gonna memorize anything and everything.</p>
      <p>Also, I'm neurodivergent and my learning style trends towards the non-linear.</p>

      <h2 id="note-45">Web Almanac on Accessibility 2024</h2>
      <p>Noted Monday, November 11, 2024</p>
      <p>Opened Slack this morning to see that the 2024 edition of the Web Almanac's entry on accessibility is live! Read it at <a href="https://almanac.httparchive.org/en/2024/accessibility">Accessibility, Web Almanac 2024</a>.</p>

      <p>They link to <a href="https://inclusive.microsoft.design/">Microsoft Inclusive Design Principles</a>. The title makes it seem like a knock-off version of the seven <a href="https://inclusivedesignprinciples.info/">Inclusive Design Principles</a>, but I suppose I'll take a small detour to read it on its own merits.</p>
      <h3>Microsoft Inclusive Design Principles</h3>
        <p>There are three principles: 'Recognize exclusion,' 'Learn from diversity,' and 'Solve for one, Extend to many.' Immediatly, I compare these to the original Inclusive Design Principles which include autonomy-centered principles like 'Give control' and 'Offer choice.' Microsoft's principles seemes like an issue-centered approach: identify the barriers and tackle them. The original principles are most focused on creating an experience that never leads to barriers in the first place. In this sense, the original principles seem more like design principles, where the Microsoft principles are more like remediation principles.</p>
        <p>Let's take a slightly deeper look. They elaborate the principles in a PDF. Interesting.</p>
        <p><a href="https://inclusive.microsoft.design/tools-and-activities/Inclusive101Guidebook.pdf">Microsoft Inclusive Design Principles 101</a> defines disability as exclusion "includ[ing] situational impairements, activity limiations, and restrictions on participation," and presents this definition as a decision agreed-upon by everyone. This is not the case, even CPACC people will tell you that there are multiple models of disability that are important in different situations. Well then, is this definition an appropriate definition for discussing accessibility in a web design context? I don't believe so. This sets us up for conversations where a temporarily abled Accesibility Practitioner tells a Disabled user experience consultant, 'You know, if our app stops loading correctly, it means that everyone's Disabled.' In treating the word 'Disabled' this way, as a synonym for 'Excluded' (why not just say that?), you're dismissing some very real economic realities and histories of eugenics, intersectionality and resistance that have, over generations, formed Disabled identities. You aren't acknowledging the role of <a href="https://robertkingett.com/posts/6617/">Access Trauma</a>.</p>
        <p>For example, there's a website with bad contrast. We have two individuals. </p>
        <p>One of them is out on a beach on a sunny day enjoying the tenth day of their 14-day all-exclusive couple's resort experience. And she can't see the text on the website. She claps twice and summons an attendant. "Yes, Miss?" She asks for a parasol. She is able to access the content. </p>
        <p>The second individual has low vision and is routinely locked out of spaces due to bad contrast issues. Seeing that he cannot see the content on this website (it's the eleventh website in the past three days), he simply move on. He's exhausted. It's not worth the effort.</p>
        <p>These experiences are not equivelant. And if you intend to seek out new perspectives and interact with Disabled people, you should know this and how to respect that Disabled person's boundaries, hesitencies and safety.</p>
        <p>I'm not impressed. I think I'm going to head back to the Almanac now.</p>
      <h3>Almanac Intro</h3>
      <p>We start with an update on national regulations coming into effect across the globe, and new data showing that automated accessibility testing results have improved. This continues the trends that we've been seeing year over year.</p>
      <h3>Aspects of Accessibility, Measured</h3>

      <dl>
        <dt>Plain language</dt>
        <dd>The almanac basically says that while readibility and understability is crucial, there is no way to measure this.</dd>
        <dt>Color contrast</dt>
        <dd>There's been some improvement, but not alot. The Almanac notes that light, dark and high-contrast support improving over browsers has complicated the situation.</dd>
        <dt>Zooming and Scaling</dt>
        <dd>Sites that disable scaling or have a max scale of one have decreased by less than five percent over the past two years. Use of relative units for fonts is still not super prevalent. </dd>
        <dt>Language identification</dt>
        <dd>There's been improvement in this area, but I'm unsure how good axe is at actually ensuring the language given matches the actual language on the page. A side note: I recently came across a false positive with axe-core, labelling 'tok' a non-valid language attribute.</dd>
        <dt>User preferences</dt>
        <dd>prefers-reduced-motion is the most popular of the five queries they measured. We have ms high contrast mode, forced color, prefers-color-cheme-dark, and prefers-contrast.</dd>
        <dt>Navigation</dt>
        <dd>Focus styles, proper use of 'tabindex,' landmarks, heading hierarchy (which has actually gotten worse!), skip links, and tables are all covered under this heading.</dd>
      </dl>
      <p>I think I'll skip over the rest of this section for now, since it's quite extensive.</p>

      <p>Noted Saturday, November 9, 2024</p>
  
      <p>Learned today that my Bakery project will probably not actually have an opportunity to be released, but I'm not exactly sad about that. It still loooks amazing and I can add it to my portfolio.</p>

      <p>Today we're returning to the auditing project I have. Mostly working through it with a spreadsheet.</p>

      <p>Noted Thursday, November 7, 2024</p>
      <h3> The Bakery Project Continues</h3>
      <p>Yesterday on Weekend Wednesday, I spent a lot of time working on the HTML/CSS Flexbox-focused project and I finally got it to look pretty. I grabbed a set of really pretty fonts, and threw together a colour palette. I can confidently say that it looks pretty good right now, though the padding isn't consistant. I want to just quickly fix the padding and throw together the bare structure of a nav. I won't take more than an hour on this. I do have other higher priority things to work on, mostly my auditing case study and getting through Deque University courses.</p>
      <p>Ended up using a full hour, but I am getting more and more used to nested flexbox shenanigans. I also learned how to make a circle: fix a width and height into a square, and set border radius to 50%. It isn't responsive yet, and I'd like to do a couple more things to pretty the thing up. But it's a solid start.</p>
      <p>Tomorrow I want to design a nice background image to compliment the colour scheme to put in the nav. But that's for tomorrow. Now it's time for some coursework.</p>
      <h3>Images, SVG and Canvas</h3>
      <h4>HTML map element</h4>
      <p>I last ran away from this because I saw the map element and I got scared. But the principals with this foreign element follow the rest of the direction for alt text. Make sure everything has concise and meaningful alt text where appropriate. If the area elements of the maps, name according to link conventions. Don't use the alt text as a place to describe things. An accessible description or caption might be a better place for that.</p>
      <p>Deque also specifies that server-side maps should not be used if client-side maps are an option. It provides no rationale for this, and I'm not familiar with what a server-side map is, so this is kinda useless information.</p>

      <h2 id="note-42">Case Study Day!</h2>
      <p>Noted Tuesday, November 5, 2024</p>
  
      <p>I've all of a sudden fell into two projects. I'm auditing a site for my friend just to build my portfolio, and I'm also working on another website so that I can hone my skills with Flexbox before I get started on grid.</p>
      <h3>HTML/CSS Project Observations</h3>
      <p>I really don't know how to make things beautiful! I also need to keep better track on all the containers that set different widths. Flexbox makes responsive design pretty easy to manage, but this website has so many components and it's hard to update everything.</p>
      <p>I think installing a nice font is the first step to make it not look so bad. I've also been undecided on what overall vibe I want it to be.</p>
      <p>Was having trouble initially trying to overlay some text on a gallery of images, but I managed to figure it out by nesting the text in a div with absolute positioning. </p>
      <p>Finding a good text size is also hard.</p>
      <p>I've accidentally built this so that if I zoom in, it still looks about the same, but it looks broken when I zoom out. Hmmmmm.</p>
      <p>Ack it looks so ugly, it's a bit unmotivating to work on.</p>

      <h3>Auditing Observations</h3>
      <p>I just need to get a good workflow.</p>

      <p>It's now almost nine in the evening and I feel a little sleepy, but I think I'm going to push forward</p>

      <h2 id="note-41">Button and Deque University 12/13</h2>
      <p>Noted Monday, November 4, 2024</p>
  
      <p>I had a indulgently restful Sunday. It was so lazy that I'm not even sure if it was energizing.</p>
      <p>But what's a more energizing start to the day than another HTML element explainer by Heydon Pickering?</p>

      <h3><a href="https://heydonworks.com/article/the-button-element/">The button element, by Heydon</a></h3>
      <p>We start off with a history lesson. Progressive enhancement was the norm back in the days when JS was unreliable. Heydon uses the example of an image gallery where smaller thumbnail images led to full-size images. This could be accomplished either natively, or progressively degraded via Javascript.</p>
      <p>Nowadays, Heydon argues that the state of JS reliance is even worse. Anchor elements as buttons are more common than semantic buttons themselves.</p>
      <p>To finish, Heydon discusses four points to anyone who wants to make faux buttons:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Use aria roles and states</li>
        <li>Emulate all other button behaviours (like Space key activation)</li>
        <li>Provide feedback by changing aria states upon activation</li>
        <li>Consider why you're doing this in the first place</li>
      </ol>
      <p>Heydon actually ends up giving not a lot of information about the button element, but about people looking to emulate button behaviour with anchor classes (or god forbid, divs!) underappreciate how much amazingness is baked into the button already.</p>

      <h3>Images, SVG and Canvas</h3>
      <p>I have my Deque window resized and zoomed, and I'm noticing that their video player has a fixed width and isn't reflowing properly. Interesting.</p>
      <h4>Alt text</h4>
      <p>Just like most other elements, the hierarchy for accessible names goes aria-labelledby, aria-label, and then alt. title can also provide an accessible name, but behaviour varies wildly. I am reminded of Sara Soueidan's advice that title is only good for providing an accessible name to an iframe.</p>
      <p>We start off reviewing the basics. All images have an alt attribute, don't be too long, don't say 'image of' or 'picture of,' set the alt attribute to null if the image is decorative or the text is duplicative.</p>
      <p>Next, actionable images. As normal, provide control information on these. Deque brings up the unique case of a QR code. Though not programmatically actionable, one can physically activate it using a camera and pointing to it. So Deque suggests alt text that describes how to interact with it.</p>
      <p>For the form input type="image" you can use the alt attribute. I didn't even know about this.</p>
      <p>As for moving content, we have the five-second threshold for visual moving content, as well as 3 flashes for second for animated images, along with a link to the <a href="http://trace.umd.edu/peat">PEAT</a> checker tool for epilepsy.</p>

      <p>Interesting note for long descriptions for complex images: the accessible description should also be visible to sighted users, because everyone can benefit. This is a best practice.</p>

      <p>This is also important because according to <a href="https://adrianroselli.com/2022/04/accessible-description-exposure.html">Adrian's post on accessible description exposure</a>, the support for consistant accessible description is not there. Especially don't use it for dynamic descriptions. In this case with complex images, it benefits everyone if the description and image is located close to each other in the DOM structure. So even if the explicit programmatic association isn't made, at least it can be found intuitively.</p>
      <p>There are two ways to give alt text to a CSS background image: aria-label (not great because it doesn't translate) and the visually hidden clip method. Ideally though, avoid doing this.</p>

      <h4>Images of Text</h4>

      <p>No Images of Text! I have just today run into an artist's website. They have used images of their own handwriting in their entire nav, and I'm wondering if CSS text styling could possibly approximate that effect. I wonder if a custom font pack could be made and downloaded and used on the site. <a href="http://2ttf.com/">iFontMaker</a> might be able to do it. That does seem like quite a bit of effort, but it might be an interesting endeavor?</p>

      <h4>Image Maps</h4>

      <h2 id="note-40">Maybe it's Not the Weekend: Deque University 11/13</h2>
      <p>Noted Saturday, November 2, 2024</p>
  
      <p>I tend to be most productive when I'm at a fast food establishment at some time with my charger plugged in. Today I have a couple goals. I want to do Deque stuff, and then I want to maybe look at some old websites of mine and start revamping them for accessibility. That way, I can add them to a 'portfolio' of sorts.</p>
      <h3>Responsive Design</h3>
      <h4>Background</h4>
      <p>I see what Deque is trying to get at with the sentence, 'you could kind of say that <em>everyone</em> has low vision, when it comes to mobiles devices' but that kinda trivializes the experience of having low vision. I would phrase it as 'when it comes to mobile, everyone needs the assistive technology known as Zoom,' or something along those lines.</p>
      <p>Three kinds of Screen Magnification: zoom provided by the browser, zoom provided by the OS, and third-party zooming.</p>
      <h4>Breakpoints and Media Queries</h4>
      <p>Media queries in CSS is something I tried to do a couple days ago and it didn't go over very well. Right now, my site has a very simple, mobile-friendly layout. But I do want to test out new layouts with flexbox and grid soon, so these are useful techniques to learn.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Query for the following sizes: max-width 700px, max-width 1060px, and min-width 1061px. These media queries are for phone, tablet and large device respectively.</li>
        <li>Query for the following media types: 'speech' for screen readers, 'print' for printers, and 'embossed' for braille printers. I feel like some well-intentioning devs querying for speech can totally not account for sighted screen readers though, so use with caution.</li>
        <li>Other fancy media queries: query for orientation (landscape or portrait). Query for progressive or interlaced scanning. I didn't know what these are: but here's a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/vfzzod/eli5_what_is_the_difference_between_interlaced/">'Explain it like I'm Five' post on scanning types</a>. Query based on the aspect ratio of the viewport, based. Query if it's a text-based device like a TTY using 'grid,' query via resolution, and what colour capacity the device has. </li>
        <li>Make it even more specific by using logical operators. The <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@media#logical_operators">media query logical operators</a> are only for use in media queries.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Deque elaborates that the breakpoints they give won't work for every situation. But it gives a handy table that adds watches as a value: max-value 320px. They encourage you to use viewport emulators to check for reflow and zooming, but say that you shouldn't test basically anything else with this. I do sometimes find it is easier to find the bugs behind things if we test keyboard-style navigation while in an small device emulator.</p>

      <h4>Images and Objects Reflow</h4>
      
      <p>Vector images will magnify without using quality. Using them, over rasting types, is ideal.</p>
      <p>Use max-width: 100% on images to prevent horizontal scrolling on mobile. Another image hack is literally providing different versions of the picture for differently sized devices using 'srcset.'</p>
      <p>For objects and plugins, prevent horizontal overflow by setting it's container to max-width: 100%.</p>
      <h4>Responsive Tables</h4>
      <p>So it talks about how for complex tables, you actually need to translate the layout to a single-column table thing for proper reflow to take place. And it gives and example. Looking at the code, it does use the 'content' property. As expected of a content property, I cannot highlight some of the text with my mouse. But Orca reads it! What?!.</p>
      <p>I've asked the slack. I have no idea what is going on and it makes me feel very small.</p>

      <h4>Text Reflow</h4>
      <p>Okay. So my website is fine in terms of the breakpoints specified by Reflow. But it does break when I set it to watch dimensions. Right now, the max-width is set to a fixed value in the unit, 'ch.' I still want to keep that, but I want to try setting the main body to have a max-width of 100%. This seems to kinda repair it, but I do need to design a stylesheet that specifically gets rid of some of this padding in the case of a very, very small viewport.</p>
      <p>Deque also has some tips for linear text reflow: let the main content fill the width of the viewport, eliminate multiple columns, eliminate floating objects, eliminate panning, and eliminate minimum and fixed widths.</p>

      <h4>Simplification</h4>
      <p>In order to fit all UI components that need to be there, Deque suggests that content can be simplified and reduced. If it is nonessential content, it can even be eliminated upon reflow.</p>

      <h4>Zoom Text</h4>
      <p>I have come across this idea of text-only zoom before, but it's been a little while. <a href="https://ashleemboyer.com/blog/an-accessibility-bookmarklet-for-testing-200-percent-text-size">Ashlee M Boyer's Resize Text bookmarklet</a> might come in handy here, so I'm linking to it.</p>

      <h3>Winding Down</h3>
      <p>And that is a wrap on that module! Huzzah! I'm browsing a little bit for fun.</p>
      <p><a href="https://devonpersing.netlify.app/posts/survey2022part1/#why-is-accessibility-important-to-you%3F">Accessibility roles demographics by Devon Persing</a> surveys accessibility professionals and asks basic questions about who they are and how they feel about their work.</p>
      <p><a href="https://theamycarney.com/2024/02/22/vpat-acr-audit/">ACR, VPAT, audit by Amy Carney</a> disentangels a question I was too distracted to research until now. Good to see that Amy is still thinking about a11y. She's the one that pilotted 100 days of A11y, the site that partially inspired this learning journal.</p>

      <p>We're a month and a half into this journey. I've learned a lot more HTML and CSS than I initially planned on learning, but I still feel like I know very, very little. I do think I need to re-evaluate and set some learning priorities for the next couple weeks. Set some goals.</p>

      <h2 id="note-38">Deque University 10/13</h2>
      <p>Noted Thursday, October 31, 2024</p>
      <p>Starting a new module: Device-Independent Input Methods. Gonna make it a light goal to get through the entirety of this today.</p>

      <h3>The Mouse</h3>
      <p>Discusses that target size should not be tiny. Doesn't describe what tiny is.</p> 
      <p>Discusses that on custom components, cursor behaviour should mimic behaviour on equivelant semantic elements. Not WCAG.</p>
      <p>Execute code when the person releases the pointer on the element, not when they press down on the element.</p>

      <h3>The Keyboard</h3>
      <p>Deque shows a custom span 'link' with tabindex set to zero and calls it a 'Good Example.' I mean, I wouldn't call that 'good'...</p>
      <p>Have a good focus order.</p>
      <p>Don't use positive tabindex values.</p>
      <p>It is mandatory that focus indicators are there. It is best practice to provide an enhanced focus style.</p>
      <p>It is best that focus indicators have some kind of outline, because background colour get smushed in WHCM.</p>
      <p>Deque shows you a pattern for a custom link with JS and ARIA and is like, 'don't get too excited about this!'</p>
      <p>Functionality must be available to keyboard-only users. No inaccessible tooltips, please.</p>
      <p>Don't keyboard trap please.</p>
      <p>Useful tip here. Deque says "For content added to the screen in reaction to a user-fired event, focus should be shifted to the new content." This would be applicable to my weird eraser widget. I didn't know you can use JS to set focus, but this could be another solution to my problem. It's not great though, because when I'm a keyboard-only user, I want to be able to just expand the menu and LOOK at it. Not necessarily to navigate all the way up there.</p>
      <p>Another nugget: When moving or setting focus, the destination element MUST contain programmatically determinable text. I didn't know this. Currently, my skip link for my table of contents goes to something that is like this. So maybe I need to change this. I can't change it to skip to the first note without using Javascript. I might be able to set it to visually hidden text. But that isn't a great solution.</p>
      <p>Am not super hyped as to how much Deque hypes up the ARIA APG.</p>
      <p>Genuinely kinda confused how people make instructions appear only when keyboard focus is received. I know you can put it to show up with the CSS :focus, but :focus will flash whenever a component is clicked on. At least, in Firefox.</p>
      <h3>Touch Input</h3>
      <p>Tapping is equivelant to clicking, so don't make something keyboard-only. Don't rely on drag and drop, and don't rely on gestures. Not all mobile devices support them, and not all users can perform them.</p>
      <p>A minimum width of 44px is good to ensure a minimum target size across web apps. On native apps, devices with 2x the pixel density need double the width. I wonder how one can query for this.</p>
      <p>They also show an instance of 'visual padding that is not part of the touch target.' They accomplish this by applying padding to an li, and not to the a that is the actual target. This makes it look like the touch target is quite big, but is only actually confined to the text.
      </p>
      <p>Deque identifies a couple of techniques that can mess with focus order for screen-reader users on mobile: .visually-hidden classes, aria-hidden="true", and onblur and onfocus. I am curious as to whether my aria-hidden hr separators fuck up TalkBack, so I'm going to test that now.</p>
      <p>It seems that my skip navigation link doesn't work on Talkback+Firefox, but it does work on Talkback+Chrome. In terms of aria-hidden, it seems to be ignoring that fine. I need to test with the iPad when I get back home.</p>
      <h3>Voice Control</h3>
      <p>Can someone use a screen-reader using Dragon Naturally Speaking? Nuance provides <a href="https://www.nuance.com/products/help/dragon15/dragon-for-pc/enx/dpg-cp/Content/Help/tips_for_vision_impaired_users.htm">Tips for vision-impaired users</a> claiming it is compatible with most popular screen readers, like JAWS. But it gives a bunch of extra tips just in case peopple have problems operating it. I've never thought about this combo before, but it makes sense that it exists. There are Blind people out there who have restricted mobility, or RSI. The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uVvWRM7WLQ">Vista Center for the Blind on YouTube</a> offers a video titled 'Dragon Naturally Speaking as a JAWS user. I will need to watch this when I get home.</p>
      <p>Interesting that Dragon actually does has some (limited) support for ARIA. I had read that there was zero ARIA support, so this is good to see. If this is the case, how in the world can a screenreader and Dragon work together? I have a hard time picturing how it all fits together.</p>
      <h3>Motion, Disappearing Content, and Transitions</h3>
      <p>Nice reminder about motion actuation and what that word means. It refers to motion that isn't a pointer gesture (like swiping) or just touching the screen. Rather, this is like shaking your phone to undo, or waving at the camera to get it it to click.</p>
      <p>Don't make interactive content move or disapear.</p>
      <p>For transitions, keep them to a minimum and make sure they aren't too slow. It can be quite bad for people with coMaybe You Don’t Need a Date Picker (added 8 February 2024 because APG added a date picker some time ago and I missed it)gnitive disabilities.</p>
      <p>Deque says to reduce the use of parallax effects and to avoid them if you can, citing vestibular issues. What is a parallax effect?</p>
      <p>From <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_parallax.asp">'Parallax Scrolling' from W3Schools</a>, it looks like it refers to an animation effect triggered by scrolling that makes the page look like it has depth. I think this is a situation of 'you'll know it when you see it.'</p>

      <p>Module complete!</p>

      <h3>Interlude: A JS word counter</h3>
      <p>Okay I did not do a good job but it did give me what I wanted, roughly. This page now has about 20 thousand words worth of notes on it. Wow. That is not very much. Or maybe it is. I used to be a humanities major, my judgement is totally skewed.</p>

      <h3><a href="https://adrianroselli.com/">Adrian Roselli</a> Articles</h3>

      <p>I have some extra time as I sit around waiting for children to come trick-or-treating to my door.</p>

      <h4>1. <a href="https://adrianroselli.com/2016/12/be-wary-of-nesting-roles.html">Be Wary of Nesting Roles</a></h4>
      <p>The title kinda says it all. I didn't know that the interactive elements specifically couldn't be nested inside each other. I kinda figured people didn't do it, but I didn't know it was actually a rule.</p>
      <p>This really makes me reconsider all the times I've seen people say that they just put tabindex=0 on random things to make keyboard navigation easier. And that is not good! Because by using tabindex=0, you've made something into a interactive component! And now you have poor nesting!</p>
      <p>Additionally, ARIA roles like button and checkbox, etc, also make these things interactive. So you can definitely create some very nesty situations if you're not careful.</p>
      
      <h4>2. <a href="https://adrianroselli.com/2019/02/uncanny-a11y.html">Uncanny A11y</a></h4>
      <p>This article describes a set of accessibility interventions that actually end up making the product less accessible than it was initially. The best part of this article is Adrian telling stories about seeing these in the wild. Some of these stories are incredible.</p>
      <p>tabindex=0 on everything is our first culprit. Adrian has seen devs use it to 'provide keyboard navigation' on native tables. He also describes seeing some people intentionally use positive tabindex values to make the visual layout out of sync with the page order. Bone-chilling, psychopathic!</p>
      <p>Our second culprit is some class ARIAbuse, in the form of providing hints by aria-label. Adrian gives one incredible example of an accessibility overlay widget that overrides every single link on the page to give 'accesibility help instructions' via an arialabel.</p>
      <p>Weird alt text patterns is our third culprit. These are the classic offenders: overdescription, redundant 'image of' or 'picture of' or 'logo,' as well as AI-generated alt text. He also points weird punctuation things when images are used inline as a potential offender.</p>
      <p>Pronounciation overrides are our forth. Just go look at the examples he gives, pure comedic gold!</p>
      <p>Alack, aria-roledescription, I knew you would show up! Our fifth offender! Using aria-roledescription to provide hints is against the whole use of that spec in the first place.</p>
      <p>Our fifth is siblings with our sixth offender: Providing unneccesary control instructions. This time, not just restricted to aria-roledescription. Using aria-label will violate 2.5.3. Even if you use a visually hidden class, you cannot write control instructions if you do not know the device. And you do not know your user, or what device (or combination of devices) they are using.</p>
      <p>The ARIA APG is our sixth offender. Adrian says that he finds himself 'standing in front of rooms of 30 developers at a time on a twice-monthly basis having these conversations' about how the APG are not a standard, and aren't robust, and do not guarantee accessibility.</p>

    <p>Noted Wednesday, October 30, 2024</p>
    <h3>Some Reflections</h3>
    <p>Today I'm thinking a lot about productivity and how to keep this whole endeavor sustainable, especially in these beginning months where my earnings are going to be slim to nil. In <a href="https://youtu.be/ALaTm6VzTBw">Weekend Wednesday (Youtube)</a>, CGP Grey makes the argument that taking a small break in the middle of the week, and then working through Saturday, is a way energy and persistance can be life-hacked to last longer. Today I might have done just that.</p>
    <p>I watched a bunch of talks from CSS Day in Amsterdam that I understood only portions of. I napped. I did some bed-rotting. I did some free code camp stuff. It did feel very relaxed and nice.</p>
    <p>I am slightly worried that every day is starting to feel like this. I need to rethink my timeline and strategy.</p>

    <p>I just spent a few minutes giving my notes post-it colours and complimentary hover/focus styles. It is a weekend indeed!</p>

    <p>Noted October 29, 2024</p>

    <h3>Typography</h3>
    <p>These are all based on Level AAA, so they won't be super applicable for auditing. Deque suggests a line height of at least 1.5 for paragraphs. So I changed it in my blog. I do think it improved readability somewhat.</p>

    <h3>CSS-Generated Content</h3>
    <p>Deque does address the CSS content thing, and says to use it sparingly. They recommend to set it to aria-hidden: true if it's decorative. I don't know how to do this on my hr so that it preserves the separator, but gets rid of saying all the pencils outloud.</p>
      
    <h3>Distraction: Videos</h3>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/ob_M_qXeDVE">Accessibility and CSS by Sara Soueidan (YouTube)</a> is very refreshing to watch. She brings up really good points about the content attribute, and also about interactive elements styled to be visually hidden. Also criticizes 'hacks' that lead to Label in Name violations. Soueidan states that aria-label will often not get translated while aria-labelledby will get translated. I thought I had read somewhere that support for aria-label was actually getting there. Also a REALLY great tip about the use of list-style none that I hadn't seen before. Lots of gems in this video.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/EOiC2M47GBY">Accessibility and CSS by Manuel Matuzovic (YouTube)</a> is an older video with a similar scope. Has a lot to say about CSS grids which seem to have been a recent release 6 years ago. Brings up a really fascinating keyboard focus behaviour when grids contain things of varying heights. Slightly more beginner friendly, which meant a lot of content here wasn't new to me.</p>

    <h3>Hidden Content</h3>
    <p>Couple nuggets here that befit typing down here for memorization purposes.</p>
    <p>When content is activated on hover, there must be a way to dis miss the content without moving the pointer away.</p>
    <p>Double check that all hidden components </p>
    <p>I'm a bit baffled by the next one. I'll post it in full for commentary purposes:</p>
    <blockquote>
      Visually hidden and inactive content MUST be hidden from screen reader users until that content is made visible and active for sighted users.
    </blockquote>
    <p>This is under "Visual Design and Colors (with WCAG 2.2 updates)" by Deque University. Uh. Doesn't the wording of this completely make supplying any content directed at screen-reader users completely illegal? What are they saying here?<p>
    <p>Deque's use of the word 'must' indicates that this is required to be compliant with WCAG 2.2 Level AA. This just feels wrong. It would be so nice if Deque cited what SC were at play as they walked through the course.</p>
    <p>Maybe I'm just misunderstanding English. This is my interpretation of that statement. If content is hidden visually, it must also be hidden from the screen reader user. Therefore, content cannot be hidden to sighted users and exposed to screen reader users. The .visually-hidden class is engineered to hide content from sighted users and expose it to screen reader users. Therefore visually-hidden breaks WCAG.</p>

    <p>There is a third posibility, which is that this restricts .visually-hidden to only replicate content that would otherwise be available to a sighted user. However, we get into a ship of Theseus situation. It is duplicate content, but it is not the same content.</p>
    <p>I can't find anything about this in the WCAG. I might be looking wrong. It feels shitty. I might have to go ask the slack.</p>
    <p>Okay, I made a post in the slack. Let's soldier on in the meantime, and revisit later.</p>
  

    <h3>Interlude: FreeCodeCamp</h3>

    <p>FreeCodeCamp doesn't teach accessibility correctly. Here's an excerpt from their module on 'accessibility.'</p>
    <blockquote>
    To increase the page accessibility, the role attribute can be used to indicate the purpose behind an element on the page to assistive technologies. The role attribute is a part of the Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI), and accepts preset values.

    Give each of the section elements the region role.
    </blockquote>
    <p>You don't need these landmarks. Also, it's totally redundant. Section already has a built in region role.</p>
    <p>It proceeds to tell you that sans serif is more accessible. That isn't WCAG. Yes, it's easier to read. But it's still not WCAG. It's also more important that the font size is larger. Grr.</p>

    <p>Noted October 28, 2024</p>

    <p>I can definitely design my eraser button to be better. Also it doesn't make sense that the eraser button does the opposite of erase content. It adds content. So maybe I should rethink the functionality of it entirely. I think I actually need it to be a toggle with aria pressed. But today we're doing more Deque.</p>

    <h3>Colour Contrast</h3>
    <p>For mobile applications, Deque suggests a contrast of 7 to 1. This reminds me that I neeed to fix how my site displays on mobile. Graphics needed to understand content need a contrast of 3 to 1.</p>
    <p>The contrast of all visual focus indicators against the background must be at least 3 to 1. I actually don't know if my blog has this sufficiently. The default focus style is probably fine, but I've customized the focus style on some components and it might not be enough. My website's dark mode is atrocious.</p>
    <p>Okay, I didn't know about the size requirement for the WCAG 2.2 focus indicators. My eraser button one hundred percent fails. It also does not have good contrast ratio between the same pixels in the focused and unfocused states. I need to restyle that. I actually need to re-do pretty much every aspect of that whole button.</p>
    <p>Another component that fails this focus indicator is the focus indicator for page=current. I am actually going to try to fix that now. </p>
    <p>I already use the outline attribute by default, so I simply made the outline bigger on hover alongside the red underscore. I think this counts as visible because the background contrast between the outline and the background colour of the document is greater than 3 to 1.</p>
    <p>Reading about the minimum contrast on UI components made me hunker down and change my eraser's styling. I still can't seem to get rid of a faint blue outline that comes in. I think I need to manually remove the user agent default in order for that to happen.</p>
    <p>Okay interesting. The size rule is actually a Level AAA criterion, not Level AA. Hence why this seemed totally whiplashy. Good to know. </p>

    <p>I wonder if there is an equivelant to WHCM for Linux? Google doesn't give me the answer, but I stumbled into this talk by <a href="https://youtu.be/CJltSqksCn0">Eric Bailey on WHCM</a>.</p>

    <h2 id="note-34">CSS Tricks 1/1</h2>
    <p>Noted October 27, 2024</p>

    <p>It's a Sunday and I feel like learning some even more CSS, so I'm pulling up <a href="https://css-tricks.com">CSS Tricks</a> and seeing if there's anything easy here that I can just look at.</p>

    <h3><a href="https://css-tricks.com/books/greatest-css-tricks/scroll-animation/">Scroll Animation</a></h3>
    <p>This trick starts with Javascript. First, we get a percentage of how much the user has scrolled down. We get this by grabbing the integer for how much the user has scrolled (window.pageYOffset) and then dividing that by the height of the document minus the height of the window. We then assign this value to a CSS variable --scroll, and we get this function to run everytime the user scrolls by simply adding an event listener 'scroll' to the document and nesting this whole thingy as an arrow function within that event listener call.</p>
    <p>That was a lot to start off with! Here's what I learned from dissecting that:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The 'scroll' eventListener exists.</li>
      <li>We can make CSS variables through document.body.setyle.setProperty()</li>
      <li>We can add event listeners to the window. Also the window is a thing. I think I only ever saw document when I was learning elementary javascript back in the day.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Let us move on to using this to value to do something. First, the author describes a simple animation that makes something spin infinitely in a 360deg rotation. I have never seen CSS animations before, let's look at <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_animations.asp">CSS animation in W3C schools</a>.</p>
    <p>We use @keyframes as a way to create code for an animation and we can control this by settting states of the animation at different percents of animation completion, or by the key words 'to' and 'from.' We name the animation and assign it to an element via animation-name, where we can also set the animation-duration, and animation-delay, iteration count, direction, and fill mode, amongst other things.</p>
    <p>Back to our scrolling animation. CSS tricks uses the animation shorthand property to make the keyframes animation called 'rotate' (which transforms to 360deg rotation upon completion of the animation) last one second, have linear timing function, and persist infinitely. This is the default state of the animation.</p> 
    <p>We incorporate the scrolling by pausing the animation using animation-play-state, and dynamically calculating the animation delay by grabbing the percent we had before and setting it into calc(), and fill-mode is set to both.</p>
    <p>To make the animation robust, iteration-count is set to 1.</p>
    <p>Let's pause here and reflect. What did we learn?</p>
    <ul>
      <li>@keyframes is a totally new concept for me. It almost looks like all the text in the keyframes is a totally new programming language.</li>
      <li>Animations in CSS are complicated and can be controlled in so many ways. But the end result is beautiful. Sometimes they might behave weirdly, so defining them as robustly as we can is a good idea.</li>
      <li>We can use calc() to dynamically set values in CSS without using javascript. Wild. Unless that's embedded Javascript. No, I don't think so. I think this is just modern CSS! How pretty!</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Interlude: Notes Structure</h3>
    <p>On this blog, Notes holds by far the bulk of the content. Right now, it's all hosted on one singular page. I like this for my own usability. I can very easily Ctrl+F search to find resources that I might have consulted in the past. But the page is starting to get a bit bloated, and I might want to offer alternative ways to interact with this page. Soon, my table of contents will be so big that it can't fit into the normal viewport. Javascript might be a solution to this. Maybe I could have it so that all entries are visible by default, but if Javascript is enabled, it will only display the first ten entries or so. Maybe twenty. And then it will load a button that will basically be like, show full table of contents, and then you can expand it that way. Maybe I'll work on that now. </p>

    <p>So at the first pass, I've accomplished what I wanted to do. Now, to make it accessible. Interaction with aria-expanded is kinda weird. I also want to make it accessible to how I use the site, when I'm only using the keyboard. I think </p>
    <p>So, the current result is definitely a work in progress. I got the thing to look a little bit like an eraser. But currently, the whole script depends on the new button and link being children to a ul element, which is not great semantically. So I will need to rewrite this by appending this all in the right places. But not now. Right now I want to get back to CSS tricks.</p>

    <p>Here's my vision: a bunch of pencils on my website. Every place where there currently is an 'hr' tag. Which means I need to probably mess with the CSS of my hr tag. But I don't think this can be done with only that. This might require some additional work.</p>

    <p>I have no idea if I did it right. I just injected pencils emojis into my hr tag via css 'content' and I feel like that should be illegal. But I like it, and I'm the primary audience of this blog, so they're here for now.</p>

    <p>I've randomly styled my table of contents to look like a sheet of looseleaf. It isn't pretty or anything. I need a solution that uses more divs and flex whatever, but what I've come up with is pretty funny. And it looks kind of cute.</p>
    <p>I learned about :before and :after for when you want to insert content. I also learned that :visited is pretty restricted. It's a shame. I wanted to insert little checkmarks after the visited links but I suppose it wasn't meant to be. I could do Javascript. Meh.</p>

    <h3>Articles from <a href="https://janmaarten.com/">Jan Maarten</a></h3>
    <h4>1. <a href="https://janmaarten.com/gaad-2023/">Socks, lies, and accessibility</a></h4>
    <p>Maarten demonstrates that accessiWasp shilling was occuring on multiple sock puppet accounts, posing to be legitimate businesses while actually being "referral sites." That is, not real. They had accounts on a bunch of platforms and even had phone numbers listed. Registered phone numbers. It's totally conspiracy-level material that Jan Maarten has found here.</p>
    <p>These accounts all promoted the same boilerplate template in the name of Global Accessibility Awareness Day 2023. </p>

    <h4>2. <a href="https://janmaarten.com/ghost-bookmark-accessibility/">Fixing keyboard focus on Ghost bookmark cards</a></h4>
    <p>Maarten describes that instead of Medium or Wordpress, they currently use Ghost to post content. Now, I don't really know how most people make websites. I have always just done everything in HTML from the bottom up and used external hosting. But here, Maarten provides a Javascript workaround for weird hyperlink placement within the hosting tool that Maarten uses.</p>
    <p>It is kinda a relief sometimes to look at a piece of code and understand what it is it is doing. Maarten comments that the solution might not be valid on paginated blogs.</p>

    <h4>3. <a href="https://janmaarten.com/cpacc/">Moving Beyond the Bare Minimum</a></h4>
    <p>In light of being recently certified as a CPACC, Maarten mourns that these basic skills are not more pervasive amongst the Designing and Developer population.</p>
    <p>I read Maarten's comments. I've touched on the CPACC a couple times in this blog, but my thoughts on it are quite complex. What does it mean to isolate accessibility expertise and to funnel it into people like me, who don't know crap about design and development? It is like making a leg operate separate of its body, is it not?</p>
    <p>Here's a question I should pose myself: If there was a button that would make all Design and Dev people instantly WCAG-proficient throughout the entire world, how sad would I be when I pushed it?</p>
    <p>This prospect of being an accessibility professional has brought such direction to my life. But it's been a rather self-serving endeavor. It has to be. That's what it means to embark on something as a career. Scary thoughts.</p>

    <p>Be the squeaky wheel, is the first advice offered. I read this as 'Take up space.' I'm not good at that. I need to get better at that.</p>
    <p>Celebrate attempts, as well as wins, is the second piece of advice. This makes sense. People love positive reinforcement. I would assume this is hard advice to give to people who experience ongoing access trauma.</p>
    <p>Steven concludes saying 'when all else fails, do it anyway.' I read from this, 'learn to do it yourself.' Right not, I don't often do it myself because I simply don't know how. I need to learn all of the things!</p>
    <p>I also appreciate Woodson's honestly about imposter syndrome in this article.</p>
    <h4>2. Various Posts on Becoming a Freelancer</h4>
    <p>Reading these make me actually want to cave in on myself. Because look at this guy! He's so professional, productive. He's talking to so many people! And he has such marketable skills. I feel like I have none of this. I actually don't think I have any of this!</p>

    <h2 id="note-30">Reflections on My First Meeting Ever</h2>
    <p>Noted October 24, 2024</p>
    <p>I learned a couple things.</p>
    <h3>Competition</h3>
    <p> First, I learned that there may be more competition in this field than I anticipated. It's hard to believe. I can't find anything about people doing this kind of work on LinkedIn, so maybe the people I'm talking to are talking to people from Ontario or something. The most impactful moment in the meeting was when I said that I was able to deliver a product that a competitor might charge double or triple the amount of money for. I wasn't sure if that was the right thing to say, but it got their attention. In truth, I don't know what other people charge. They might be out here charging $100/hour. They might be charging $20/hour. It's hard to make statements about being cheaper than competitors if I literally have no basis from which to judge that metric.</p>
    <h3>Disposition</h3>
    <p>Secondly, I need to work on my professional persona. I come across as naive, young, and inexperienced. I need to come across like I know my stuff, and I didn't do that as much. I can maybe still preserve a slight dash of youthful innocence, but I need to sound more like I can get the job done. The odds are already stacked against me in terms of my positionality. God, sometimes I really do wish that I was just a straight white man with facial hair and a big ego.</p>
    <h3>Orientation</h3>
    <p>I needed this meeting to be a pitch meeting. But I didn't know that until I was midway through the meeting. I needed a pitch, and I didn't have one fully formed. I will be better prepared next time. It sucks, but I do need to take on the attitude of a salesman. I thought that talking about DEI and strategy would be enough. That was a naive assumption.</p>
    <h3>A Coincidence</h3>
    <p>The first job interview I ever did in my entire life, I was interviewed by my childhood bully who used to beat me up in first grade. The position was for a day camp counsellor.</p>
    <p>Yesterday, I learned that the people responsible for this potential client's website are the same people that were in charge of the other website I audited one year ago, the first website I ever audited, and the thing that lead me into the field in the first place.</p>
    <p>Somehow, these two coincidences feel very similar.</p>
    <h3>Self-Esteem</h3>
    <p>My self-esteem was absolutely crushed after this meeting. It was bad. I need to be able to bounce back faster from failures. Failure is a win condition. I need to be able to tolerate failure!</p>

    <h3>So What Exactly is Button?</h3>
    <p>Buttons should be distinguishable from text, Deque says. But the example they give is four icons that have text to them. Two of these icons are a gear icon with the text 'Settings' and a envelope with the text 'Contact Us.' These look like links to me. But maybe some links are buttons. I am rather confused.</p>
    <p>I would have thought that a button uses the button html element. Or a div or link using aria roles. But crucially, it activates a change of state on the page, right? Let's research.</p>

    <p><a href="https://a11y-101.com/design/button-vs-link">A11Y-101's article 'Button vs Link'</a> is basically what I described and conforms to my expectations. They elaborate that some CSS frameworks can steer developers into conflating the two of them and make the argument that buttons and links should be visually distinct.</p>

    <p><a href="https://yatil.net/blog/buttons-vs-links">Eric Eggert's article on Buttons vs Links</a> has the headline: No, they are not the same. He notes a couple of cool behaviours. For example, buttons can be activated with a space, links cannot. Buttons don't come up on screenreaders when they fetch a list of all links. Buttons use a normal mouse pointer on hover, use a pointing hand mouse on hover. In terms of styling, Eric recommends some kind of visual distinction, but he isn't as particular. Descriptive text for functionality is more important for users to understand where they are going.</p>

    <p>Stepping back for a moment, I suppose my concern stems from Deque using 'button' to refer to something that really does look like a link. It might just be an oversight. But I think if it is, it's revealing a commonly tolerated inprecision in language that probably perpetuates devs using the wrong element, because in common speech, the two are interchangeable. I suppose I'm being influenced by Adrian Roselli's super strict view on language precision in naming patterns and components. I'm sure there are more urgent cases that require addressing, but we can maybe put this on the waiting list.</p>

    <h3>
      Scoping Table Headers
    </h3>
    <p>It is not enough to simply designate some row or col through table headers. You also have to establish which data that row or col is associated with using the parameter of 'scope.' All data also needs to have the scope of 'row' or 'col' to work.</p>
    <p>This is bit confusing for me, so I'm going to try to do it myself. I've created a small spreadsheet in LibreOffice Calc, and I'm going to try to recreate it in HTML according to accessible standards.</p>

    </table>

    <p>Okay, it isn't exactly amazing but it works and now I know about cool CSS selector tricks like :nth-child and :first-child and :not(), so I think it was worth it. </p>

    <p>Deque also shows how to associate certain cells with heading using the headers attribute, linking directly to each table heading's id.</p>

    <p>Additionally, nested tables breaking table heading and scope functionality so do NOT use them.</p>

    <h3>Table Summaries</h3>
    <p>A table summary is meant to improve understandability. Deque orients this towards SR users, but likely everyone can benefit from this. It lists a couple techniques that can be used to support this: putting it in figure's figcaption (pair with aria-labbeledby on the table itself), putting it in the caption element, visually hiding it, and associating a description with the table through aria-describedby.</p>
    <p>I'm incredibly suprised to learn that the "presentation" role exists. Harm reduction, I suppose. </p>

    <h3>Iframes</h3>
    <p>I know zero things about this. Should be fun!</p>
    <p>Iframes need a title. I feel like this is definitely something I've looked past before.</p>
    <p>Okay, I'm a bit bamboozled. There's a second page on titles that says the source page of the iframe must have a valid title (they're using MUST here, so it's WCAG). But we can't control some of these. It seems like this is specified because of JAWS behaviour. I'm kinda bamboozled, need to consult external sources.</p>
    <p>The wording is a little bit weird, but in a different section of Deque, they basically say that this weird behaviour is mostly concerned with documents. So documents also need an accessible name, and it should ideally be the same one as you put in the title attribute just so experience is the same across the board. I don't have JAWS so I can't test to see if this behaviour still persists.</p>
    <p>The thing about trying to preserve heading hierarchy between the child iframe and the parent website seems a bit strange. Say I was hosting a pdf file on my website, and just wanted to show a preview using an iframe. Should I mess with all the heading structure of the pdf just so that the iframe hierarchy structure should be presersved? This just leaves a really odd experience to anyone who uses the pdf file on its own, not in the context of the document. I'm sure it applies to some cases, but it feels weird.</p>
    <p>Use aria-hidden="true" for meaningless iframes. I feel like there should also be a bypass mechanism. </p>

    <h3>Not-so-useful Semantic Elements</h3>
    <p>I've never in my life heard of the 'q' element before. I'm also so surprised that their section on blockquotes is so sparse. Adrian and Heydon's guides are much more comprehensible, and illustrate how complex this element actual is below the surface.</p>
    <p>There's also a note on the code element. I am very bad at the code element. I write everything in raw HTML and the code element makes me backspace and double check that everything is oriented properly-- it's just a hassle. I genuinely think that if I insisted tagging every instance of code on the website by hand, it would make me want to not post to this website any more.</p>
    <p>The pre element is suggested to accompany large blocks of code. I've also never heard of pre. I'm excited to see it whenever it pops up in Heydon Pickering's HTML elements guide.</p>

    <p>del and ins should be used for strikethroughs and additions but must be supplemented with visually hidden text or some other kind of mechanism. The mark element is the same for highlighted text. Make sure visually hidden supplements are available for critical instances of these things.</p>

    <h3>Good Markup Practices</h3>
    <p>These were once all considered essential to meet 4.1.1 but now that's deprecated. Deque has preserved the pages relevant to this for posterity.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>ids should be unique on a page. This is also good for satisfying Name, Role, Value.</li>
    <li>Parent-child relationships are good. This is apparently most impactful when the ARIA roles are misaligned somehow.</li>
    <li>Don't use deprecated elements and attributes. Interesting how width as an attribute is deprecated on td and th, but is valid as a style.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Interlude: Course Complete!</h3>
    <p>I'm officially done the Semantic Structure and Navigation course. I'm going to just zoom through one of the easier ones now on Accessibility Fundamentals. I've covered a good part of this material already through other courses, but I suppose this is also a good course to just zoom past and secure the certificate.</p>

    <h3>Disability Fundamentals</h3>
    <p>It's pretty exhausting that every single instance of a Disabled person using tech has to somehow make the additional point that the Disabled person has thus 'overcome' their disability in some capacity. And that metric is decided by their ability to participate in civil society. Why can't some non-extroardinary people real people feature in these examples?</p>
    <p>This all just feel very outdated and like it was designed by people who don't know the field of Disability Studies, which is what my background is somewhat in. Much less Crip Studies.</p>
    <p>COGA goes far beyond just the one example they gave of Down Syndrome. It also betrays the reality of most folks with intelectual disability. Most of them don't have any particular diagnosis beyond the state of 'intellectual disability' generally, which is defined via a IQ test. If there was any place to give a wealth of different examples, this would have been the place.</p>
    <p>Meh. I have notes. They need to hire someone from the humanities to have at this course.</p>

    <h3>Distinguishing Links from Text</h3>
    <p>The wording here is a little ambiguous, whether it is necessary to provide a hover style that is not just a change in colour. It definitley is the case for links, I just don't know about hover styles. Is this WCAG?</p>
    <p><a href="https://www.tpgi.com/a-whole-lot-of-bovver-over-hover/">Ian Llyod of TPGi</a> makes the case that it is not a WCAG failure, as the hover is not seen as essential functioning. People can only trigger hover by moving their mouse to the required thing. Maybe if everyone was operating system with invisible mouses, this would be a requirement. But that isn't the case, so Ian doesn't think it fails any of the Contrast SC. Focus indicators, on the other hand, can fail Non-text Contrast.</p>
    <p>In other words, I don't need to fix the Hover style on this website!</p>
    <p>Deque also gives another friendly reminder that navigation menus are an exception for underlined links.</p>

    <h3>Interlude: My Website Needs a Skip Link</h3>
    <p>Rolling up my sleeves here. I've been putting it off because it looks scary. But I think it's time.</p>

    <h2 id="note-27">Access Trauma and the Aesthetic World</h2>
    <p>Noted October 17, 2024</p>
    
    <p>Mastodon seems to be my newest way to pick up new articles to read up on. I am feeling more optimistic than usual, a client actually might be on the horizon. I am terrified. I feel the stakes.</p>

    <p>It's apt that I somehow came across the work of <a href="https://robertkingett.com/map/">Robert Kingett</a>, whos articles I'll be doing commentary on today. I've been doing so much work on the technical side of things and haven't paused much to examine the more theoretical, justice-based aspect of what it means to participate in the accessibility space. I've been thinking about what it means to set a rate for my services. What am I profitting off of? How do I participate in this space in a way that is most world-building? How do I embark on my own internal accessibility journey as a Disabled subject myself, with many access priviledges that the people I am advocating on behalf of don't have?</p>

    <h3>1. <a href="https://robertkingett.com/posts/6617/">Combatting Access Trauma</a></h3>
    <p>I suppose I am struck by a hence of devastation in reading this. There is nothing positive about access trauma. I think it mirrors how I've seen some BIPOC narrate their experiences of racism, and it mirrors how I've seen some Indigenous people narrate the experience of settler colonialism over generations. Kingett uses the words, 'relentless, unforgiving.' As if there was some sin on the part of the victim that brought this upon themself.</p>
    <p>Access trauma. I don't experience that. When I audit stuff, I experience, perhaps a empathetic version of access frustration. I might say, 'Please, you should have known better. I don't know HTML and even I know this is clearly wrong.' I always have so much empathy for that person who designed the inaccessible website. I don't easily perceive the harm.</p>
    <p>Perhaps it relates somewhat to this other feeling I've had recently: My ASL is not that great and it won't get great until I use it a whole bunch. Hearing people get all up in arms about the idea that only Deaf people are allowed to teach ASL, or that Deaf people have the final say on what ASL is and is not. But hearing people don't carry that access trauma that has caused ASL to flourish into the beautiful linguistic miracle that it is, despite all of the horrid persecution that has attacked. Perhaps ASL is beautiful because of that persecution. I'm rambling at this point.</p>
    <p>I also think about the beauty of Protactile. And in reading Kingett describe the pursuit to "cultivate spaces where [they] don't have to battle access trauma," I think about how generative those results can be. The whole of humanity is better for it when Deaf and Disabled people live in systems that include them. </p>
    <p>Reading my words back, I think the word 'beauty' might not be coming across in the way that I intend it to, and my inner Tokiponist is not satisified with that. I think it is good when people can take care of each other while living autonymously in kinship environments that can catch them when they fall. I would like to live in a world like that. And I see that happening linguistically in the languages of ASL and Protactile.</p>
    <p>The feeling described in Kingett's article appears to me that it doesn't apply to people who only have temporary disabilities. I suppose my question would be: is access trauma characteristic of what it means to be Disabled? Could we perhaps even use this framework as a kind of litmus test? What harms come from exercising this idea?</p>
    <p>In my own work as a communicator, how do I convey the urgency to people who are not Disabled? Are the words, 'relentless and unforgiving' resonant?</p>

    <h3>2. <a href="https://robertkingett.com/posts/6567/">TTS Audio Description</a></h3>

    <p>I once was sitting opposite a very well-respected accessibility advocate in my city. She's potentially the most respected in the entire city. I was asking her about why the videos on a certain platform that she was responsible for, weren't audio-described. I had only started to embark on my journey. I was curious, but I was also a bit judgemental. She looked at me shamefully but confident, and answered as if she hated every single syllable that left her mouth. She described that during COVID, they had released a batch of videos that sought to educate Disabled people on the benefits of vaccination, and to prepare them for the rollout process. They paid an enormous sum to get these videos audio described. It took up a very substantial part of their budget. To date, these videos have 2 views each.</p>
    <p>There was a very real financial argument for the 'undue hardship' placed on this organization to meet this requirement. It was a non-profit that could not even grant benefits to half of their full-time employees.</p>
    <p>And this was my first introduction to the realm of audio description as an accessibility requirement and how hard of a barrier it is to meet.</p>
    <p>Kingett's article describes the practice of Text-to-Speech Audio Description as being craft-less. Audio Description is an art of its own, and the offloading of such an art to AI scriptors and speech synthesizers does not appreciate this fact. It is not enjoyable. It does not create a beautiful experience, it creates mere compliance. It's sterile, flattenned, void of colour. "It's not inclusive," Kingett writes.</p>
    <p>This is a good article for me to be exposed to. I understand this argument. I had never been exposed to the aesthetic experience of audio description before. As an artsy person, I resonate with this. I agree that it's horrifically sterile. It also makes me want to learn how to write audio description and to explore it as a medium of art unto itself.</p>
    <p>For videos like that vaccine information one, perhaps the cost minimization that the AI tools could provide would be worth it. A person does not walk into a vaccine information video to be aesthetically pleased. But the other side of this is that AI makes mistakes, and I can't imagine how sensitive it would be in conveying such important information as a human could.</p>
    <p>This does make me increasingly interested in learning at least the fundamentals of audio description. I already have skills like making transcripts and caption writing. It seems like a skill that wouldn't not be useful to have.</p>
    <p>Blind audio description writers remind me slightly of Deaf interpreters. Deaf interpreters work alongside a hearing ASL-English interpreter to communicate to another Deaf person in the most reflects Deaf worldviews and visual communication culture. They often are called to interpret high-stakes situations when there can be no misunderstandings in meanings. They also may be employed in mental health contexts. Between blind AD writers, and Deaf interpreters, there is this idea that there is a cultural layer that only fellow peers have access to. When this cultural layer is involved, the level of inclusion spikes wildly. We're not really talking about sterile accessibility in this case, we're talking about something more.</p>

    <h3>3. <a href="https://audio.mcsweeneys.net/transcripts/against_access.html">Against Access, by John Lee Clark</a></h3>
    <p>I somehow also stumbled upon this piece in my Mastodon feed today, and it brings together ideas that I've been talking through from the previous two articles.</p>
    <p>I'd prefer that you read the text again instead of looking at my summary here. John Lee Clark is DeafBlind and is one of the leading figures in the new Protactile movement. Protactile is a language that was developed by DeafBlind, for DeafBlind, and emerged naturally when DeafBlind started to meet together without using sighted interpreters. It is also a philosophy about making freedom where you won't be provided it, creating communities of peers, and prioritizing your own aesthetic experience instead of trying to model the hearing and sighted world within your own home.</p>
    <p>In this essay, John Lee Clark describes an alternate to the paradigm of 'accessibility.' Instead of prioritizing 'how to make the thing accessible,' prioritize beauty within the constraints of the tactile world, and then run with that. For Clark, the sterility and near scientific hunt for accuracy that proponents of 'access' hunt leaves the emotional and beautiful world unrepresented in a series of highly 'accurate' but unappealing replicas. In order to achieve inclusion, Clark needed more than just translation. He needed a transformation of the information to fit the way that he navigates the world. He needed whatever 'translation' to accomodate the communication values that he has as a Protactile user.</p>
    <p>I suppose reading this article, the conclusion I come to is that access is not enough if we want to create a world that is beautiful for Disabled people. It doesn't mean that the goal of accessibility is any less noble, it just means that it is egotistical to assume that it alone is sufficient to create the endgame. Accessibility, as John Lee Clark narrates it, cannot create joy. That is the work of some other goal. Maybe, full participation of Disabled people in society is what we need to fix this.</p>

    <h2 id="note-26">Articles and Shmarticles</h2>
    <p>Noted October 16, 2024</p>

    <p>I have a lot of administrative things to do today, so my session might be very brief. Yesterday, tables did a number on my psyche. But it might just be the person talking. Faulkner re-linked a post on tables that they wrote back in May, so we're gonna start with that.</p>

    <h3>1. <a href="https://html5accessibility.com/stuff/2024/05/22/not-so-short-note-on-aria-label-usage-big-table-edition/">Steve Faulkner on Tables and aria-label</a></h3>
    <p>I haven't actually come across the words 'implicit' and 'explicit' yet, but I understood this concept when I had my 'aha! moment' regarding roles five days ago. Faulkner pairs this glossary with a couple of rules for labelling. Labels that are visible are better than labels that are hidden, and when present, should behave as expected (after checkboxes and radio, before everything else) and you should rely on native roles over any kind of ARIA implementation.</p>
    <p>Hmmm, I don't know of any scenario where an anchor element with a valid destination should be given an aria-label that overrides text content. Maybe if it's an image, and you wanna override the alt text? Regardless, Steve indicates that this is a valid case. </p>
    <p>Also discusses some potential misuse of the abbr (abbreviation) element that I am most certainly guilty of on another one of my websites. Very conflicted on how to provide an accessible experience for that one. Maybe some kind of hidden text thingamajig would help. It's a pretty unique case and it is particularly ideological. I'll deal with it later, back to Faulkner's content.</p>
    <p>Good to note that aria-label is not supported in blockquotes very well.</p>
    <p>I should start marking code using the code element, but I don't know where to start. Let's test it now. <code>aria-describedby</code>. I don't know anything really about how this affects different user experiences. <a href="https://www.digitala11y.com/wai-aria-rolecode/">DigitalA11Y discusses role=code</a> in relation to how it presents on screen readers. The screen reader will read out exact punctuation. This is another diversion, back to main content.</p>
    <p>Interestingly, it overrides the legend element in fieldset, and overrides figcaption in figure.</p>
    <p>So it should NOT be used for images, which means the alt shouldn't be the accessible name. What's the point with it being okay to use on 'anchor' then?</p>
    <p>Key takeaway from this article that I'm getting after looking over all the Things: just because you can add an ARIA label to something, and it is permitted under WAI-ARIA 1.2 specification, it doesn't mean you should do it.</p>

    <h3>2. <a href="https://www.matuzo.at/blog/building-the-most-inaccessible-site-possible-with-a-perfect-lighthouse-score">Matzuo's Perfect Lighthouse Score with Piss-Poor Accessibility</a></h3>
    <p>I have heard rumours of this article, but today was the first time I saw it linked, so let's dive in!</p>
    <p>A delightful read! A lot of these feel like 'gotchas' and I wanted slightly more real-life feeling instances to drive the point home that this happens all the time on real, breathing website, and not just a website that is optimized to be unusable. Though, I suppose this article is speaking to people who don't have a good idea of different ways technology can support alternative user experiences, so it has to target itself at the seeing population of mouse-users.</p>

    <h3>3. <a href="https://www.tpgi.com/making-the-web-accessible-a-focus-on-cognitive-disabilities/">Cognitive Accessibility with Melissa Morse</a></h3>
    <p>Plain language is something I'm interested in, but the practice itself appears to be poorly defined. Sometimes using simple words is actually obfuscating, I know this as a Toki Pona speaker. Toki Pona requires a person to break down things into their basic components, but then it requires the interlocutor to really zone in and lesson to the relationships that join all of these very simple parts together. It's a process that can be quite mentally taxing. Of course, they're not talking about this when they say 'plain language.' But from my view, 'plain language' seems like something that is very easy to not get right. I wonder how the field of plain language specialitists sorts itself out. I saw a website of such a person the other day.</p>
    <p>Interesting that within this first section of the article, Morse doesn't offer the idea of 'language summaries.' I'm a big fan of this.</p>
    <p>A final comment is given to the increased focus of COGA in the latest WCAG. They're all triple A standards though. Unusual Words, Abbreviations, Reading Level, and Pronounciation. I don't know how people evaluate 'Reading Level.' What is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flesch%E2%80%93Kincaid_readability_tests">Flesch-Kincaid readability test</a>? Oh my god, it measures syllables per word. I promise you, I am capable of writing some really freaking dense thing using minimal syllables. This is not a good formula. They're also not speaking toki pona. This seems a bit underthought. </p>

    <p>Noted October 15, 2024</p>
    <p>Back after a long weekend. Let's get cracking, lads!</p>
    <h3>Single-Key Shortcuts</h3>
    <p>Deque brings up the example of Gmail as having lots of keyboard shortcuts. I remember I was trying to use it a while back. Native keyboard navigation was not great. I couldn't seem to open any emails and I had to just enable keyboard for that. Some other applet thingies have a learning curve with keyboard navigation. Slack, I couldn't manage to figure out either. I have a low attention span and it just didn't work out for me.</p>
    <p>Also on the topic of single-key shortcuts, I have a bookmarklet but I don't entirely know how to operate it. I should learn to do that at some point. Alright, I feel like I know what's up now. The wording on the ReadMe is a little bit weird, but I get it now.</p>

    <h3>Distraction: CSS</h3>
    <p>I'm literally spending so much time just styling my focus indicator in new interesting ways, and adjusting my colour palette. My hover indicator is cool now! </p>

    <h3>Tables</h3>
    <p>Tables should be named via caption or aria-labeledby and you shouldn't use weird spanned columns because it can be frustrating to navigate. column or row headers need to have to be meaningfully described in a th element and must have an appropriate scope attribute (either "row" or "col").</p>

    <h3>Showing the Current Page</h3>
    <p>I added styles in my main nav to indicate the current page, and I also added aria-current="page" to those same things. I feel like I don't typically notice when this feature is implemented, but I suppose I will start noticing now. I kinda wanna learn how to implement a skip link. And speaking of which...</p>

    <h3>Skip Links</h3>
    <p>I was reading the portion on Skip Links and became curious about how it related to SC 2.4.1 Bypass Blocks. Because the keyword that Deque uses for these things is 'should' instead of 'must.' Which means it isn't actually in the WCAG, and this was surprising to me! What else could bypass blocks possibly be solved by? First I read the official wording, <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/bypass-blocks.html">SC 2.4.1 Bypass Blocks from W3C</a>, and then I read through this <a href="https://github.com/w3c/wcag/issues/1712">Issue thread for 2.4.1 Sufficient Techniques.</a> I totally agree that H69 should be removed as a sufficient technique. Actually I agree most of the sufficient techniques grouped under section 2 are very suspect. Reading through all the a11y people talking about this was quite illuminating.</p>
    <p>Eric Eggert in particular had a couple notes about what it means to be listed as a sufficient technique. As did Steven Faulkner.</p>
    <p>Something I am still curious about: What if your nav has like 3 items? Should a skip link still be provided? Is it needed? It really doesn't save that much time.</p>

    <h2 id="note-23">Preparing for a Potential Client</h2>
    <p>Noted October 12, 2024</p>

    <p>Have a potential client, and I've promised to send them a bit of a package for them to review prior to our first meeting. But I don't quite know the direction I'm going to take this, so let's start by taking a look at their website. If I know what the endgame is, I can prepare for it.</p>

    <p>I'm typing this out here because I have major task avoidance regarding this, so here's to hoping it all turns out well. Watching Matuzovic yesterday doing preliminary audits was oddly motivating.</p>

    <p>Here are some things I am noticing in the audit:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>This case doesn't need a lot of work. They've clearly run basic tests with accessibility in mind: axe picks up only one region declaration suggestion, no errors, and no critical errors are abound at all. It is fairly impressive.</li>
      <li>But there are still broken features. For example, the bypass blocks mechanism bypasses more than the navigation and actually skips past pretty important content. This is a very easy fix, but it's probably the most glaring issue of all that I see, and it's actually the first thing that made me consider approaching this client.</li>
      <li>Reflow is also not perfect. The dev has opted to put a lot of content into a banner style thing that probably has some kind of fixed width. For aesthetic purposes, it opts to cut off content instead of reflowing it properly. That's the second worse thing.</li>
      <li>There was a pretty critical issue early on where absolutely no navigation functionality was available on mobile view. That has since been solved, I actually noticed that quite a while ago.</li>
      <li>The person has gone for a pdf indication (which is great!) but has used the title attribute instead of aria-labeledby and visibility-hidden. Another good solve would be putting it in alt text. But they did think to include it. They did go so far. They also have a shit ton of amazing labeled-by implementation on the blogs and 'learn more' sections of the site.</li>
      <li>So that was present on a key pdf. But the content authors that are normally on the site don't do this kind of thing. The content authors also don't often add alt text. The whole 'Sponsorship' sections for one of their evenets was just littered with linked images with the file names as set alt text. It wasn't pretty to look at.
      </li>
      <li>Consistent navigation is another potential failure. Let me back up a second, recently, this client had a rebrand and had a whole other website built from the ground up. For whatever reason, they did not adapt their e-commerce section (Event registration) or Event portal. All of that functionality of their website is redirected from the new site to the old site. And the old site and new site differ in navigation. I have to presume that their plan is to eventually reincorporate a new version of the event site. But I don't know exactly.</li>
      <li>There is also some things regarding the degree of feedback the user gets after input that would be nice. Not all of the search functionalities provide feedback in the header title element as to what things are. Autofocus after searching would also be a nice touch. These are all things that are nice to have, but not essential.</li>
      <li>I am also slightly worried about the use of captchas on the site. And I haven't yet seen anything about cognitive tests, but I am still learning about that criterion so I shouldn't speak too soon.</li>
      <li>Testing on mobile is quite revealing. It is not.. Good.</li>

    <h3>span links</h3>
    <p>Nice to see the whole role="link" tabindex="0" pattern laid out for me because I would have thought that the role="link" would have been enough for the thing to receive focus.</p>
    <p>Also good to see that horrid span Javascript not-link pattern called out as a 'Bad Example' in this text. I came across it on my own a week or so ago and was so horrified. I suppose the way this pattern could be vaguely improved is role="link" and tabindex="0" but it's just bad. Oh it's so bad.</p>
    <h3>Link label precedence</h3>
    <p>title will be overtaken by anchor text (including alt text), which will be overtaken by aria-label, which will be overtaken by aria-labelledby. This makes aria-labelledby misuse potential because it can override what would otherwise be considered 'normal' behaviour.</p>
    <h3>Visually hidden text</h3>
    <p>Okay so I've seen many snippets use some kind of form of this but I've never stared right into the logistics before. clip is used to make the text invisible and it looks like it clips out a shape from the..? What? Let's look into this with another source. </p>
    <p>Whoa okay so according to the<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/clip">MDN web docs for 'clip'</a>, the feature is deprecated and replaced by '<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/clip-path">clip-path</a>.'</p>
    <p>I am confused. What is a shape function? wow it can move?! What?!</p>
    <p>Okay a lot of this doesn't apply to my use case. I am going to look elsewhere for examples of hiding text from sighted users and shoving it onto screen reader users. Let's peak in on an artical by <a href="https://www.makethingsaccessible.com/guides/visually-hiding-text/">Darren Lee.</a></p>
    <p>Darren's first example illustrates where a mismatched aria-label can fail Label in Name and can prevent voice-navigation people from accessing your content. Darren eventually goes on to show a custom .visually-hidden class in CSS and uSo Deque gives this example that a role="navigation" shouldn't directly be applied to a ul. The rationale is that the "ul" already has a role as an unordered list and the navigation role would override that.
      ses both clip and clip-path to achieve it. Very confusing because there is not explanation of this code.</p>
    <p>Time for a new article, this time by <a href="https://www.tpgi.com/the-anatomy-of-visually-hidden/">James Edwards at TPGi</a>. And the question's answered, and many other things clarified. What we essentially do is make whatever content we have into a 1px by 1px square, and then use clip/clip-path to hide it. clip, being deprecated, is included in the pattern to support Internet Explorer. Technically, most browsers support a 0 width and 0 height on this pattern. But Safari's the one exception, so we can't just ignore them. And this fantastic article also links to a really great O'Hara article that advocates that we need to fix other things so this pattern is not needed. Edwards refers to .visually-hidden as a 'hack.' I think that's accurate.</p>

    <h3>Distraction Time: Live Auditing on YouTube</h3>
    <p>Found a set of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1-dDbgQP5E&list=PLfynVUhSmWhPNEu1bgPMhCbkz9fTGlPep">videos by Manuel Matuzovic</a> that have him walking through websites checking for accessibility features. It's really cool to see someone else do this in real time! And I am kinda excited by the fact that I know everything he's talking about. It's in German, but Matuzovic has captioned his videos and so the auto-translate works amazingly. Good stuff!</p>
    <h3>Consistent Navigation</h3>
    <p>I didn't know the whole rule applies to link text + destination. Makes sense though!</p>

    <h3>ARIA role breakthrough</h3>
    <p>So Deque gives this example that a role="navigation" shouldn't directly be applied to a ul. The rationale is that the "ul" already has a role as an unordered list and the navigation role would override that.</p>
    <p>This helps me better understand what a 'role' is. Because of course as we all know, roles are already baked into HTML5 and when we use most native elements, we don't need any kind of ARIA role applied. Here's the kicker: because it already has a role. ARIA roles and the native roles are the same thing. I thought they were somehow different! AA okay but they aren't. They are the same thing. What does this look like on the back end?</p>
    <p>Okay here's another breakthrough. People have been talking so much about the 'Accessibility Tree' right and I've really had little idea of what they meant by that. I of Course saw that whole Accessibility panel in the Firefox inspect panel. But I didn't ever.. look on the left side of the screen? I was just looking at the 'Name' column and not the 'Role column.' But it's all there. It's all there for you. It's so obvious. Oh my gosh I can't believe I missed this. Before people were talking as if it was so obvious to find the role of any given thing and I was so perplexed by How it was possible. I thought that people had memorized that oh, anchor elements have the role of 'link' and all these various things have these various roles. I thought they were getting all of this from the pure HTML but No. This makes So Much More Sense. Part of my 'Aha' moment can be attributed to this handy tool that lists <a href="https://russmaxdesign.github.io/html-elements-names/">HTML elements by accessible role by browser</a> in a handy little chart.</p>

    <h3>Distraction Time: Trauma-Informed Design</h3>
    <p><a href="https://dfrlbook.com/chapter1">Design for Real Life</a> is free now! says Mastodon. It has a very impactful Chapter 1. But the lack of attention of accesssibility within the online version of the text has me thinking that while this is a text I should get to eventually, maybe it shouldn't be my priority now.</p>

    <h3>h1 comments</h3>
    <p>Good to see Deque reiterate the 'one h1' guidelines. I previously had trouble sourcing this, I had seen it on a Yale guide but I had to hunt it over and over again. Interesting exceptions for overlays, and for blogs constructed similarly like this one. I think that the way that I've set this up is accessible? Right now, I have a 'back to notes' link at the bottom of every entry. I like this because I can navigate easy to the table of contents when I'm on Keyboard only mode, like I am now. I am unsure how convenient it is for screen reader usability. It might mess with the amount of links. It's also probably not great that every single blog post is smashed onto one page. It would be a bit beyond me right now to separate them out into distinct pages. Maybe I should reconsider this at some point, for ease of navigation purposes.</p>
    <p>Why, oh why, is it not possible to navigate via heading on VoiceOver and TalkBack? Is there any particular reason that this function isn't supported? Is it not suitable? Seems suspect.</p>

    <p>Noted October 9, 2024</p>

    <p>I'm getting lazier about recording down the progress of my learning. I've started on the module titled Semantic Strucuture and Navigation. Here are some things I'm struggling with:</p>
    <h3>Accessing Landmark menu on Talkback</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>I can't manage to access any function that will list all landmarks. Deque gives these instructions: Swipe up and right to access the local context menu, then 'landmarks will pop up.' </li>
      <li>When I do this though, here are the options it gives me: Read from focused item, Copy last spoken phrase, Spoken language, Screen search, Hide screen, Voice commands, TalkBack settings, Text-to-speech settings, Braille display settings.</li>
      <li>There's nothing about landmarks. I went into the 'customize talkback menu' area of settings and there was nothing there to enable landmark navigation either. Which sucks. Or maybe I'm just doing the gesture wrong, who knows.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Language shifting</h3>
    <p>So, you're supposed to change the language whenever you have text in another language. Even on the word-by-word basis. To what extent does this apply? There are many loan words in English. Loaning is such a popular mechanism for word formation.</p>
    <p>Here's some tangible instances that I can think of: Often, fans of anime will refer to that anime by its Japanese title instead of the English one. But they will write the title out in latin characters. For example, a fan of Attack on Titan might say: "I love Shingeki no Kyojin! It's my favourite anime. I think everyone should watch SnK." Do I have to put language tags around that? In theory, the title has just been loaned. It isn't even in the Japanese script. But they are unambiguously words that aren't in English. Do we put them in a span and tag them as Japanese?</p>
    <p>What about websites that are teaching language? Do they have to tag every single instance of the foreign language with alternate tags? That can really add up.</p>
    <p>What if the language doesn't have a two digit ISO code? What if it has a three-digit one? Does it make sense to provide a two-digit one as a backup if the screen reader doesn't support it? For example, Spanish is a very popular choice for rendering Toki Pona. How does that even work? Is there some kind of query you can do to check for that? I have no idea how that works out logistically.</p>

    <h3>Backwards compatibility</h3>
    <p>Deque recommends setting all landmarks to display as block and to use Javascript to preload tags that may not be support in Internet Explorer 8 and below. I would have liked for them to spell out IE without acronymning it, but whatever. I do like to see these examples of techniques that can be applied pretty consistantly and that really cater to inclusive design.</p>

    <h3>Who Benefits from Landmarks</h3>
    <p>Deque suggests that there is little benefit for sighted users for landmarks, or really anyone outside of screen reader users. That's why they introduce the ARIA roles and html5 elements as interchangeable. A correctly placed main does help everyone though. Are there ways to access these through switch controls? There really should be, that seems like a really good feature. A Google search reveals that other folks have thought the same thing and implemented it through an aptly named <a href="https://www.tpgi.com/improving-access-to-landmark-navigation/">Landmark Extension</a>.</p>

    <p>Briefly, I'm reminded of what Heydon says how we will never know our users, and we should never seek to know our users, and we don't need to know them. We just need to design for the technology.</p>

    <h3>role="heading"</h3>
    <p>I don't like this but I understand why it's there. Is it possible to apply ARIA roles in CSS? Is that a stupid question to ask? Yes it is probably. I thought I read somewhere at some point that aria-level was a broken attribute in some browsers, but I completely forget where I read that and I might have literally dreamed it.</p>
    <p>Note to self: a classic definition of a heading in plato's cave must have content associated under it. Or else it ain't a heading.</p>

    <h3>Technique for New Window Indication</h3>
    <p>The idea behind this is to use describedby to point to a piece of text that is both .visually-hidden and aria-hidden that is then put onto an anchor element. I'm ever skeptical of aria, so let's look at other sources to see whether there's issue with this kind of implementation.</p>
    <p><a href="https://adrianroselli.com/2022/04/accessible-description-exposure.html">Adrian's article on aria-describedby</a> features a lot of video evidence as to how this interacts with different engines. And it's not supported universally in all contexts. Adrian recommends to not rely on this for critical information. In the thing suggested by Deque, this is probably fine. The information is not critical, it's unprescence doesn't fail a WCAG criterion specifically. But it is not great. Adrian also links to some other articles and I'll take a peak at those too.</p>

    <p><a href="https://www.tpgi.com/describing-aria-describedby/">O'Hara's aria-describedby article</a> is from 2018, but it's still clarifying. aria-describedby is only used in interactive areas, with some edge cases. Scott makes a similar conclusion that while the feature is very useful and good, relying on it critically and uniquely is a no-go.</p>

    <p>Also nice to come across aria-described and just as normal, it's Safari that's dragging everyone else behind. Catch up, Apple.</p>

    <p>Deque also suggests that outside websites should be noted externally. Disapointing that there's no easy icon or whatever that shows this.</p>

    <h3>Links must be visually distinguishable</h3>
    <p>Cue Heydon and their 'Underline your fucking links, nerds!' or whataever it was. If it is in an obvious navigation then it doesn't count. That was the one piece I was missing.</p>
    <p>In terms of people who don't want to underline their links, uh contrast ration of 3:! is pretty drastic.</p>

    <h3>Weird Question</h3>
    <p>With aria-desrcribedby and aria-described being in such states they are in, is it permissible to fuck with an image so that the image doesn't appear but the alt text will appear on hover if there is a screen-reader user? That doesn't seem right but I wonder about how bad it could possibly be. </p>

Working with freeCodeCamp is okay, but it's very not great when their recommendations are not accessible or best practice, and that happens a lot.

Maybe this is otherwise worded as don't use an HTML element in a way that makes it appear as something else and it becomes confusing as to what it actually is?</p>
    <p>Adrian clarifies the intention of the menu, menubar and menuitem ARIA roles. They are intended to be used to act like a desktop application. Like VScode, for example, has a menu bar in the top. web applications aren't like this. The vibes are different.</p>
    <p>Adrian also clarifies that the HTML5 element nav should be used in most scenarios over the ARIA role 'navigation.' This ARIA role is the role</p>

    <p>This helped. I asked it to really, really dumb it down for me and to focus on it's relation to SC Name, Role, Value. Basically, WAI-ARIA helps in the design of some advanced components that don't have native HTML equivelants. It can also be used for live region alerts, when designers insist on using placeholder= as a label, for Icon-only buttons. Most of this can be revealed using Devtools when auditing. I'm going to try to look at Roselli's articles listed under ARIAbuse.</p>

I closed all my tabs, turned off the 'limit' timer on TikTok and YouTube, wrapped myself in my weighted blanked, and took time to myself. It's hard to explain the amount of factors yesterday. I'm reminded about the article about spoons and neurodivergency, and I felt that in action yesterday. Some unexpected things happened yesterday during the day, and when my touchpad's settings got overrided by a ghost yesterday, I completely broke. And as a result, I don't want to learn about WAI-ARIA today. I need someone to tell me how to do it. The video I tried to watch wasn't helpful. I still feel so ashamed. It's such a little thing but it feels like everything. So we're going to be kinder to ourselves today. And we can get back to WAI-ARIA on Monday.</p>

    <p>I recently was taught the explicit+implicit pattern in freeCodeCamp, so it was good to see that they were doing something right. It was a surprise to learn about implicit association, but I suppose it makes sense, though why doesn't Dragon support this? To be fair, Dragon doesn't seem to support many things. Does it even support ARIA? I was reading yesterday that it might now. But that article was from a while ago, should check again.</p>

    <p>I basically know everything here already but I was interested in this article because I never heard the word 'sensor' used this way before. Fascinating. How do devices actually sense gestures like shaking the device? Is there a little eardrum and eardrum fluid in the device? Is it a tiny wee ball that rolls back and forth? Not to mention, how does the device know that I am holding it upside down?</p>
    <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accelerometer">Accelerometers</a> measure the force of acceleration on itself at any given time and can therefore determine the angle it is held at based on how the acceleration changes, unless the device is in free fall.That's how devices know where they are oriented in space.

Which would be a different conversation, I think. How do we make location information and complex directions accessible to Blind people? A map is such a visual medium, would a medium change be necessary here? The article is short and doesn't answer this question.</p>

    <p>ARIA is the scariest part about all of this. I'm actually very nervous to get into this. I don't know where to start. I have <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/aria/">the WAI-ARIA Overview page</a> open in front of me. This is honestly very scary and I haven't even started it. Let's read the introduction. Or something. Let's just start taking notes. Can't keep procrastinating and stalling by typing poetry here. Or maybe I can. Who reads this? Who waits for me here? Are you waiting for me to give up this facade, to tell you some new information, are you only here to mock me?</p>

    <p>How do people even pronounce UAAG? Is it a groan? Because that's how I feel right now.</p>

    <p>I am done the page. I don't understand some things. Does 'rich' Internet applications mean that it was funded by more than one dollar? How is it that most form controls are readonly? Don't you have to.. use them? What? Also, when I'm using a keyboard I have no freaking idea how to access these secret region-marked navigation techniques. Are they just referring to screen readers as 'keyboard-only users' here or what exactly is going on? What page do I click on next?</p>

    <p>Looking at <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.2/">WAI-ARIA 1.2</a> actually gives me a panic attack. What the hell is this?</p>

    <p>Deep breaths. I'm so disoriented that my touchpad is behaving incredibly weirdly and whenever I disable my touchpad using my keyboard shortcut, it just doesn't get disabled. WTF. Also Slack just kicked me out because I use Firefox ESR. What is the world even coming to?</p>

    <p>I'm going to watch a video and swear to god if this is trash I'm going to go and make myself tofu.</p>

    <p>I AM EXTREMELY DISORIENTED. WHY IS IT NOT LETTING ME DISABLE MY KEYBOARD.</p>

    <p>Here's the deal: all of my keyboard settings have been completely overriden by a fucking ghost. Two finger scrolling is disabled. The speed is all innacurate. It's all wrong. It's all wrong! And that would normally be fine because I can now navigate by Keyboard but it's NOT LETTING ME DISABLE IT. And it doesn't get disabled when I'm typing so FUCK!</p>

    <h2 id="note-15">Scatterbrained Notes</h2>
    <p>Noted October 3, 2024</p>

    <p>Haven't updated here in a few days, but I've been caught up in freeCodeCamp, as well as with case studies. Here's some random things I've learned about during that time:</p>





    <h3>Widgets, in a Squarespace Website</h3>
    <p>I was on a squarespace website that looked promising. It was fairly simple, with apparently no form elements, so I thought it would be a doozy. And then the widgets. Two widgets injected into the native site: one of which could not be tabbed onto, and the other was hell to operate by keyboard alone. I didn't even get to evaluating these widgets thoroughly, I was so perplexed by how widgets are made and sold and incoporated into these otherwise okay websites. One of them, a take-out ordering system that didn't receive focus, was a span element with two scripts underneath it. It seems it was the scripts that button-ified the span in some way, but that wasn't available within the HTML markup, so it bamboozled me. How could it be a button, if it was just a span with no visible anchor element?</p>
    <p>This got me thinking. Initially, I would have figured that the fix would be simple: just add a tabindex=0 to the span. But if the anchor element was made within the Javascript and if it had all of the styles applied secondarily, would that even work?</p>
    <p>I tried in the Inspector and it worked. So I was confused. Because surely, if there was no focus there, the Javascript must have somehow overruled the tabindex to be -1 or something. Something must have been done to override the native anchor behaviour. Unless.. maybe there are ways to make links that don't require anchor elements?</p>

    <p>And then I found <a href="https://www.willmaster.com/library/web-development/linking-without-an-a-tag.php">this horrible anchor-less span link pattern</a> hosted on a website with some of the worst tab indexing I've seen in my life. Now, I am not so proficient to decipher whether this is the exact kind of pattern that this widget-maker used to get their span to become a link, but just knowing that this is out there makes my stomach churn. This should honestly not exist.</p>
    <p>The same widget-maker also manually set all of their tabindexing using positive values. Seeing that in the wild was honestly wild.</p>

    <p>I don't want to comment much on the second widget, a reservation booking platform, because being that keyboard navigation was neigh impossible, it's obvious that whoever made this website did not account fo accessibility when choosing a vendor.</p>

    <h3>Smaller Note on Text Contrast</h3>
    <p>On a couple websites, there was a bunch of floating light-coloured text against some kind of busy background. I was thinking about ways to remediate this. My first instinct is to put a solid border around the text itself.But that isn't a property that exists in CSS, right?</p>
    <p>Here's <a href="https://kinsta.com/blog/css-text-outline/">how to add an outline to text</a>, using two different properties. -webkit-text-stroke is one option, but it doesn't have great interoperability. text-shadow requires a little bit more work but it has better support. This should be a strategy that can remediate for contrast requirements across many of these websites. I hadn't noticed it before, but Adrian Roselli uses this a lot on his blog.</p>

    <p>My brain is going, "See? A11y isn't about what we have to subtract, it's about what we add to our plate!" and simultaneously I'm thinking of an example of a nav that had something like 120 links in it that I saw the other day. Certainly we can cut out some of those links, right? Shift left, shift left, shift left.</p>

    <h3>Ethical Dilemna</h3>
    <p>The most accessible website that I found during these past few days was built using a website builder and hosting service that is owned and operated by colonizers of Palestinian land. Finding that out was like a suckerpunch to the gut. I am really comforted by people like Heydon Pickering and Steven Faulkner who champion progressive values within the accessibility work, and I especially like the <a href="https://heydonworks.com/hire/">tagline</a> that Heydon has on their website: "I do not work with surveillance capitalists or religious organizations engaged in proselytization."</p>
    <p>I need to be so vigilant and selective about which organizations I approach when all of this gets off the ground.</p>
    <p>Two minutes later update: I just found another website made by the same hosting service and the accessibility is NONEXISTANT. So glad to see this!</p>

    <h2 id="note-14">You're (Maybe) Not Going to Learn A11y at FreeCodeCamp.org</h2>
    <p>Noted September 28, 2024</p>

    <p>It's a bold title, I know. And it's also probably preemptive. I started on the 'Responsive Web Design' course offered by FreeCodeCamp and I see not great accessibility practices. Accessibility is an essential criteria, why not teach good accessibility practices throughout? Why are you recommending these contrast things that kill WCAG Contrast (Minimum), why are we suggesting to use target="_blank" by default, why are we putting alt text on decorative images?</p>
    <p>Like, I understand. This is an entry level course to people who have never done anything computer-related before in their life. And I see the eight or so modules down, there a big thing dedicated to 'Web Accessibility.' But if we are talking about shifting left, we need to integrate these things from the beginning. How hard is it to just mention, this is a decorative image, so let's set the alt text to null? Even mention that WCAG exists! Gosh sake.</p>

    <p>It's so frustrating because the course does bring up the word 'accessibility' more frequently than you'd think. But it doesn't actually teach WCAG-compliant practices, much less best practices. Of course, I'm only on the third module. It just feels icky.</p>

    <p>I am curious, is the website freeCodeCamp.org itself WCAG 2.2 AA Compliant? I would be surprised if it is. I'm now used to expecting inaccessibility by default. I don't need to get this heated. Slow and steady wins the race.</p>

    <h2 id="note-13">Inclusive Checklist(s)</h2>
    <p>Noted September 26, 2024</p>

    <p>I happened upon Adrian Roselli's <a href="https://adrianroselli.com/2019/08/basic-custom-control-requirements.html">Basic Custom Control Requirements</a> and Heydon Pickering's <a href="https://github.com/Heydon/inclusive-design-checklist">Inclusive Web Design Checklist</a>. I thought I'd read through them and make notes!</p>

    <h3>1. Roselli's Checklist</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>New word alert: i18n is a numeronym for 'internationalization.' Writing modes are included for when text has a vertical orientation. Roselli recommends CSS logial properties in 2020, is this still relevant? Reading through <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_logical_properties_and_values/Basic_concepts_of_logical_properties_and_values">the MDN web docs for logical properties,</a> this is so cool! It seems like a lot, can this be added to the body property? How does actually incorporating this look? I wonder if there's a write-up explaining how to provide support with this technique. Or maybe a pattern I can reference? Adrian has <a href="https://adrianroselli.com/2019/11/css-logical-properties.html">CSS logical properties guide</a>!</li>
      <li>Big takeaways from the logical properties guide: inline is the text plane, block refers to the opposite axis. Use start and end in place of left and right. Offer support for browsers that don't support it. (Would progressive enhancement be the right term to use here?)</li>
      <li>Leans on defaults: in other words, replicate expected behaviour from semantic html elements.</li>
      <li>Another tangent by looking at <a href="https://adrianroselli.com/2017/02/avoid-default-browser-focus-styles.html">avoid default browser focus styles,</a> another Roselli article. This is actually very good to know. I have not been testing with browsers outside Chromium and Firefox ESR, who both have decent default focus indicators. I actually generally prefer the Firefox default style (still in my Keyboard era) because the sites I browse have the focus overriden by people who clearly do not care about focus visibility. I didn't know that on older browsers, the focus indicator was that bad!</li>
      <li>Good to see WHCM and colour scheme and reduced motion preferences all listed together. I've been seeing each of them mentioned separately but I've never seen them all grouped together as a 'kind' of thing to check for.</li>
      <li>Also didn't know to check if Zoom is suppressed. I didn't know this was a problem, Firefix ESR overrides this setting.</li>
      <li>Print styles!!!</li>
      <li>How do we check that a site doesn't override user font settings?</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Interlude #1</h3>
    <p>So I just set my focus styles on my site to be a nice contrasty orange box. Not sure why I chose orange but Orange Shirt Day is upcoming, so maybe that's why? I also got curious abouut titles. I was under the impression that titles are just the name of the site, but actually they should reference the specific page. Makes sense. Dunno why I thought otherwise. I'm looking at <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Techniques/general/G127">Technique G127</a>, but is there any best practice guide that is more specific?</p>

    <p>Jackpot. A best practice guide for title by Amber Hinds titled <a href="https://theadminbar.com/accessibility-weekly/every-page-needs-a-meaningful-and-accurate-title/">Every Page Needs a Meaningful and Accurate Title</a> and it looks like it knows what it is talking about. I love this article, it's so specific! Big Takeaways: need to avoid duplicate titles. I also need to include the website name, and an emdash is an acceptable solution to tier them. I never even thought that this would be an important consideration for results appearing in the 'history' tab. I feel empowered to set proper title attributes for everything in my site! I really should do this across all the sites I author content for.</p>

    <h3>Interlude #2</h3>
    <p>I was checking a site for contrast and was looking at the APCA, because Seirdy recommended it. I looked through the slack for more guidance, backread the logs, and then concluded by reading Eric Eggert's entry, <a href="https://yatil.net/blog/wcag-3-is-not-ready-yet#so-should-you-use-apca">WCAG 3 is not ready yet</a>. WCAG 2 contrast does need to be reworked. What is the best way it should be reworked? I think Eric makes some very good points and critiques of APCA rollout. In an ideal world, way more resources would be dedicated to W3C and to a11y research so that this area can be researched more. Even the APCA guy admits, that there needs to be so, so much more research. But in the meantime, I'll try to make my site support a dark mode that has enough luminescence so that the content is perceivable.</p>

    <h3>2. Heydon's Checklist</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>New world alert: terse. Seems to be another word for lili pona. </li>
      <li>New word: raster. It is the opposite of vectorized.</li>
      <li>16px is the default text size. New knowledge.</li>
      <li>What the hell is a service worker?</li>
      <li>Need to learn more about what media queries are in general.</li>
      <li>Lazy loading is named here as a positive, still have in mind Seirdy's suggestion for lazy rendering. I have no idea how to implement any of them so I don't know what the point is.</li>
      <li>Need to put everything in landmark elements.</li>
      <li>I figured the whole 'pure white or pure black shades' was a thing. I think it has to due with the pure white being a bit intense. Need to get around to fully investigating the rationale.</li>
      <li>Textual labels. This is labels that you can see. For voice activation. Makes sense.</li>
      <li>Print stylesheets aren't in the WCAG, right?</li>

    <h2 id="note-12">What Skills? (Scrap)</h2>
    <p>Noted September 25, 2024</p>

    <p>Up until this point my notetaking sessions on this blog have been pretty thematic, but this actually doesn't capture the process that I've been taking these days of staring at the A11Y Slack and delving into various article that link to these articles and those articles. I've not made notes on a lot of those articles that I scanned. I want to take two steps back today and actually focus on a strategy for learning going forward.</p>
    <p>I need to do more case studies. I also need to take a skill-build approach. Here's some skills that would be nice to just have, taken from Donna Bunguard's presentation <a href="https://youtu.be/i4iVndHHDFk?list=PLn7dsvRdQEfFompoGO_CE5z-_HjEdgVit&t=557">The Myth of the Accessibility Unicorn</a>.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Screen reader proficiency.</li>
      <li>Mobile accessibility testing.</li>
      <li>Automated testing tools.</li>
      <li>Test script development.</li>
      <li>Manual testing techniques.</li>
      <li>WCAG knowledge.</li>
      <li>Compliance awareness.</li>
      <li>Written communication skills.</li>
      <li>Documentation and reporting.</li>
      <li>Continuous learning.</li>
      <li>Problem-solving abilities.</li>
      <li>Accessibility advocacy.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>What doesn't feature on this list is equally notable. The approach I am taking is more centered on inclusive design than on what this list suggests. WCAG knowledge and compliannce awareness does not constitute the body of knowledge that one needs to understand the range of user experiences that might occur from different patterns. Screen reader proficiency, well which one? Mobile testing, well which one, and what kind? There's also nothing about document accessibility here. I think some basic knowledge of this is needed.</p>
    <p>It also doesn't say things like 'good html,' or 'ARIA' or Javascript. You need some familiarity with this to assess why patterns are doing what they are doing.</p>

    <p>I've been obsessed with Heydon Pickering's content recently. Here's another great idea from another one of their articles, <a href="https://24ways.org/2016/what-the-heck-is-inclusive-design/">What the Heck is Inclusive Design?</a> It reads: HTML is a toolkit for inclusion. Their stance that 'universal design' and 'inclusive design' are the same thing, except 'inclusive' is more honest, seems inaccurate from my understanding. It seems like they have two different ideological positionalities. Inclusive design feels a hell of a lot more feminist and internationalist, than the idea of universal design does. But I'm going off of vibes right now. This is not scientific evidence for anything.</p>

    <p>Maybe I need to write a skill checklist or build like a report card, or self assessment for myself. I'm saying this because my current approach is unfocused, just as is any initial hyperfixation dive.</p>

    <h2 id="note-11">Blog Notes: Adrian Roselli Edition</h2>
    <p>Noted September 24, 2024</p>
    <p>Today I'm taking some peeks around Adrian Roselli's blog, that gives a whole wealth of information. I want to read it like a textbook. My goal for this will be notes on five articles.</p>

    <p>1. <a href="https://adrianroselli.com/2023/08/progressively-enhanced-html-accordion.html">Progressively Enhanced HTML Accordion</a></p>
    <ul>
      <li>I have read through this twice now. My lack of knowledge in conditional HTML and CSS applications are making me unable to see how this works without Javascript enabled. This also makes me want to understand more about what aria-labelledby means.</li>
      <li>Still struggling to see how this accomplishes what is needed for it to be called an accordion (accord(ion)-ing to Roselli's definition of an accordion) but a secondary reference to this article offers some insight. Roselli refers to the accordion he builds in this article as "still requiring ARIA and Javascript." This utterly bamboozles me. So what does progressive enhancement mean in this case? In this case, I suppose that it means the information is all technically perceivable without the JS but the presentation is just not there. Isn't that a gap between user experiences? I am struggling to understand how this is a 'Progressively Enhanced HTML Accordion' if it just is a 'Javascript-dependent accordion that is otherwise just a set of disclosures that a person can run through.' Are these two ideas synonymous?</li>
      <li>I might be missing something here. Maybe the ARIA is doing something.</li>
      <li>There is some really advanced looking transition-y CSS here. It would be nice to know how to do this myself.</li>
      <li>Note to self: custom components design requires you to think about how it will look when the page is printed. Seirdy put a lot of emphasis into this and I though they were a little bit wack for bringing it up so often, but I suppose seeing it being considered again should make me change my mind.</li>
      <li>Fascinating that an accessible component can indeed be so user-hostile. Reminds me of Pickering's talk on simple is better. I love the quote here "This post is an attempt to at least make them equally user hostile for all users."</li>
    </ul>
    <p>2. <a href="https://adrianroselli.com/2022/06/keyboard-only-scrolling-areas.html">Keyboard-only Scrolling Areas</a></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Adrian opens by describing a contention between keyboard-only and screen reader interaction. We want to add tabindex to a scrollable element, but we end up verbose (since we now have to add a role and value).</li>
      <li>Apparently, this is not an issue in Firefox. I use Firefox, hence why I have not encountered problems with this necessarily yet. Adrian also suggests enabling caret browsing to get around this issue in browsers that aren't Firefox.</li>
      <li>Reading through the saga of getting Chrome to support this feature makes me horrified. I didn't know that FAANG companies can just lie about their update logs. That seeme like that shouldn't be allowed. Also Apple being absent is... not surprising?</li>
      <li>Major takeaway: try to not have scrolling areas. If you do, set tabindex to -1 and include proper roles and labels, writhe that you can't limit the verbosity for screen reader users, and mald at Apple for not listening to Adrian Roselli.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>3. <a href="https://adrianroselli.com/2020/04/avoid-aria-roledescription.html">Avoid aria-roledescription</a></p>
    <ul>
      <li>There is basically no usecase for aria-roledescription. Don't use it to offer hints. Don't use it for the thing it is supposed to do. It just overrides the original role and language-locks it. Don't use it to standardize a user experience across screen reader users.</li>
      <li>There are <em>some</em> use cases but be incredibly thoughtful about it and keep into consideration the localization factor.</li>
      <li><a href="https://html5accessibility.com/stuff/2020/10/06/micro-note-on-aria-roledescription/">Micro-note on aria-roledescription</a>, linked to be Adrien, is hilarious. Sidenote: I am finding a11y memes incredibly comforting and motivating as I slog through this learning journey.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>4. <a href="https://adrianroselli.com/2019/10/stop-giving-control-hints-to-screen-readers.html">Stop giving control hints to screen reeaders</a></p>
    <ul>
      <li>The WCAG doesn't ask us to put in these descriptions and I am reminded of Hayden Pickering's You will NEVER know your users talk here.</li>
      <li>The videos here are very, very illustrative. The verbosity and redundancy is actually ridiculous.</li>
      <li>Helpful link to a repo recording how different elements and controls are announced by different screen reader/browser combos, <a href="https://russmaxdesign.github.io/accessible-forms/">HTML test cases</a>, and it has VoiceOver, NVDA and JAWS (no orca or talkback, but those are two I currently use primarily for testing so I suppose it works out?)</li>
    </ul>

    <p>5. <a href="https://adrianroselli.com/2014/11/dont-use-tabindex-greater-than-0.html">Don't use Tabindex Greater than 0</a></p>
    <ul>
      <li>I first learned about this in a TPGI presentation, but it will be nice to examine it in detail.</li>
      <li>This turned out to be a post about the inaccessibility of captcha. I'm not surprised. It's a cognitive test, most of them. I want to know more about how it fails WCAG standards though, that sounds spicy.</li>
      <li>Good that HTML5 now warns about using positive tab index.</li>
      <li>I should know more about the shadow dom.</li>
      <li>New word alert: anti-pattern.</li>

    <h2 id="note-10">Day Two of Keyboard Only</h2>
    <p>Noted September 22, 2024</p>

    <p>I didn't think I'd come up with another entry on this so early on in the process. I intend to experiment with Keyboard-only for at least the next week, maybe even beyond. I type an embarassing amount of search queries ending with 'keyboard shortcut' into Firefox. I often forget about how to do the things. It's obvious that the learning curve is great.</p>

    <p>But this entry isn't about complaining about the learning curve. It's about the fact that so many of the applications that I want to use are no longer accessible to me. Yesterday, I mentioned that I can't share my screen without at least one manual touch on my laptop screen. Today I found that Roll20 (used for Dungeons and Dragons) and Colonist (a Catan spoof) both have no support for Keyboard-only users.</p>

    <p>It was naive of me to think that both of these platforms which are international in nature and very dear to me, would have this kind of support. I think I was operating under some kind of idea that all the websites of companies local to me were inaccessible and/or had little keyboard support because my area is a bit of a brain drain. But Roll20? That should've been a no brainer. I was so naive. The site is unusable.</p>

    <p>There are a few keyboard traps that I've had to navigate out of. F6 is helpful, but surely there are more sophisticated techniques. I use Ctrl+F Esc+Enter a lot to get to links that I can't otherwise get to. That is certainly new information. I now better understand what the P2: Workaround available was describing in <a href="note-6">this earlier post</a>.</p>

    <p>I do get angry when it isn't accessible. I don't know that I necessarily have the right: I can enable my touchpad at any time, and my screen is a touchscreen. I want to meet people who actually use this approach with their tech. I haven't yet found a blogger that is a Keyboard-only user speaker on A11y issues. I should do that as soon as possible.</p>

    <h2 id="note-9">Concerning Focus Indicators</h2>
    <p>Noted September 21, 2024</p>

    <p>Failure descriptions for a non-visible focus indicator are described twice in the WCAG 2.1 documentation: <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Techniques/failures/F55">Technique F55</a> and <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Techniques/failures/F78">Technique F78</a>. Technique F55 deals with a situation where the focus comes onto the element, and then is removed for whatever reason. Technique F78 deals with styling that leaves the focus indicator invisible, for whatever reason.</p>

    <p>I do like a consistent looking focus indicator. I don't like it when it changes forms on me. But that's just a personal preference. It's good to know that a consistent indicator isn't actually prescribed according to WCAG.</p>

    <p>But what even causes things to not be able to be tabbed onto?</p>

    <h2 id="note-8">Entering my Keyboard-only Era</h2>
    <p>Noted September 21, 2024</p>

    <p>I just disabled the touchpad on my device. I still have the potential to cheat (my laptop is a convertible and has a touchscreen). But it seems like a good idea to become fluent in a variety of different kinds of interactions with devices. Keyboard-only with site seems like an ideal first pass.</p>

    <p>My first anxiety: I don't know how to open new applications! I have VSCodium open, Firefox with some tabs open. How do I open a new application? </p>

    <p>I'm using KDE Plasma, so I'm looking at this video titled <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5PzIbOTP50">Challenge: KDE Plasma only using Keyboard!</a> The YouTuber here is struggling to access stuff in the bottom right of the screen. This video isn't really a tutorial but a proof of concept, so let's just go to the <a href="https://docs.kde.org/stable5/en/khelpcenter/fundamentals/kbd.html">KDE Documentation</a>. I have now learned about the Meta key. I can open new apps with ease!</p>

    <p>Holy shit we managed to navigate to the panel using Meta+Alt+P! This means I can use the custom power consumption program that I would have literally no way to navigate to otherwise!</p>

    <p>Next task: adjust the spacing. Currently my windows are split right down the middle, I want to adjust the split in my screen to the left.</p>

    <p>I have my System Settings Shortcuts up and am looking at the shortcuts associated with KWin, the Windows manager. There is a thing to 'edit' the tiles, but it doesn't seem to accomplish what I want it to accomplish.</p>

    <p>Unfortunately, I'm having a lot of fun. But Keyboard-only breaks frequently on KDE. I have to go back and forth just to get focus back, it seems. But I have resized my tiles, successfuly! It just requires Alt+F3, tabbing to 'resize.' Perfect!</p>

    <p>I have also discovered caret browsing. I am dying here, this is so amazing! I can now select text just by shifting, after enabling F7 of course! Good stuff! I also want to know how to do it without caret browsing, by using a combination of Ctrl+F and pressing the Esc key. Afterwards, things can be selected via Ctrl+shift and arrow key navigation. </p>

    <p>I do appreciate all of the little hints that Google gives me. Activating Discord is also pretty daunting. I am curious to see how much I really can do with just a keyboard. So far, the only thing I truly found myself unable to do was streaming to Discord. The windows selection app by KDE, called 'Portal,' didn't let me tab to select which part of my screen I wanted to share. I'm going to try a couple more times, I might just have to mess around with it a little.</p> 
    
    <p>I took a screenshot of the issue and was trying to edit it using the file viewer in KDE called 'Glenview.' Unfortunately, I'm locked to the bottom left corner of the Glenview application and can only increase and decrease the zoom on the photo. I can't access the editing tools.</p>

    <p>I'm not surprised that it is KDE features that seem to have the least support. I already know what a nightmare Orca is, so it is unsurprising that this is also not so user friendly. Hold on a minute, I have just found a work-around for screenshot cropping. It turns out the screenshotter does have some support, so let's get this arranged.</p>

    <p>The file manager, Dolphin, is not so intuitive either. Perhaps I'll table this and attempt to put the screenshot in tomorrow.</p>

    <p>I've somehow messed up my windows proportions and now they aren't tiling correctly. Alas, the learning curve!  </p>

    <p>Noted September 20, 2024</p>

    <p>Most people who go through something like the hundred days of A11Y or who take on careers as consultants take on the full CPWA: First starting with the CPACC, and then going in on the WAS.</p>

    <p>I do think the CPACC will be worth getting within the next year, and maybe I ought to start targeting preparation at that. There is only one other person in my city that has CPACC. I also don't think CPACC will be very difficult to get. I have covered a lot of these kinds of things in my previous positions. But I do have some hestitation.</p>

    <p>Part of me is already disillusioned, based on Adrian's post <a href="https://adrianroselli.com/2024/01/under-supported-and-underpaid.html">lamenting the state of a11y professionals</a> and specifically calling out IAAP for catering to overlay companies. This does make me want to not give money to them.

    <h2 id="note-6">First pass at a Tier List</h2>
    <p>Noted September 20, 2024</p>

    
    <p>I'm taking inspiration from my notes on Eric's blog yesterday to note down or hierarchize what accessibility failures are of first and ultimate priority. Eric offered four criteria to start with: Pause Stop Hide, Three-Flashed Threshold, Audio Control, and Keyboard Trap.</p>

    <h3>Framework 1: Five Priority Levels by Intuit</h3>

    <p>After a bit of scrounging around on Google, I've found this source by Intuit that lays out 5 tiers of priorities, titled <a href="https://blogs.intuit.com/2020/05/19/setting-priorities-for-accessibility-issues/">Setting priorities for accessibility issues.</a> Here's what their system looks like:</p>
    <dl>
      <dt>P0: Non-interference requirements</dt>
      <dd>This level cites the four same criteria that Eric sites. This can totally break the user experience and is the most likely to complete obstruct user flow. Major legal concern.</dd>
      <dt>P1: Interference/impossible to use</dt>
      <dd>This tier also encompasses critical failures that are not covered by those four non-interference as cited directly by the WCAG. This includes custom elements and accessible names (non-perceivable) that interfere with user flows. Major legal concern.</dd>
      <dt>P2: Workaround available</dt>
      <dd>This level describes instances where the user can still manage to get through the user flow by deducing the surrounding information, or using sophisticated keyboard control to break through a 'soft keyboard trap.' It's where there's clearly a barrier there and it *should* for all accounts and purposes, be considered broken code. Yet there is just enough stuff going on around that the product is still usable, by the hair on one's chinny chin chin.</dd>
      <dt>P3: Tedious/Annoying</dt>
      <dd>Lisa puts things in this category like broken Skip to Main Content links, redundant information, custom components that require a bit more extra thinking to use than if the semantic equivelant was used. I know the author's intention here and I see the caveat s they put in the desciption. But hell, Skip to Main Content can be very, very tedious for switch control users. And I'm already seeing an instance where the Skip to Main completely obscures information from the screen reader user.</dd>
      <dt>P4: Non-Barriers</dt>
      <dd>This describes things that either fail the guidelins but don't actually interfere with any user flows (the example here is given for improper labling of elements that are actually never interacted with by the user) or instances that take away from what would be best practices.</dd>
    </dl> 
    <p>Lisa Rathjens, the author of this post, gives plenty of caveats while outlining this framework. I've also inserted some of my issues with it. It's incredibly pragmatic and does not at all lean on best practices accessibility, or digital accessibility that falls beyond WCAG's scope. But I think it can be adapted to fit a more best-practice centered-model. This is a good start, I'm curious to see what else is out there.</p>

    <h3>Framework 2: An A11Y Issue Prioritization Matrix</h3>
    <p>The author of <a href="https://www.hassellinclusion.com/blog/accessibilitys-goal-is-to-fix-issues-not-just-find-them/">this prioritization tool</a> talks in terms of cost-benefit analysis and project management, so I can already tell that this framework is not going to sit as well with me as Lisa Rathjens' framework. But also, the audience of this tools appears to be slightly different.</p>
    <p>This matrix is proposed as a communication tool to motivate project managers and the people actually doing to remediation to feel that the work is worth pursuing. I struggle with this framing because accessibility should be considered a baseline and these arguments run counter to creating a larger culture that considers disabled clients to be as worthy of reaching out to as any other client. But I also understand that the BBAs and BAs live in two separate worlds, right now. Enough of this tangent. Let's look at the four scales that the matrix ranks against:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Extent/Frequency of occurence. How many pages within the website does it impact, is it present at key user flows?</li>
      <li>Size of audience impacted. I don't like this one, not going to lie.</li>
      <li>Impact of the issue. This is equivelant to non-interference/interference/workaround/tedious, except this framework only lists the levels of 'high, medium, and low.'</li>
      <li>Estimated cost. Also don't like this one.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>The matrix then creates two values: Value for money, and Political Risk Aversion, by multiplying different values across these four matrices.</p>
    <p>I actually don't have a lot of good things to say about this framework, the word choice here is unfortunately too pragmatic for me. It doesn't think enough about impact and it wants me to not prioritize issues that only a minority of users are going to encounter. Reading this over, it seems like it runs counter to the principles of inclusive design. Additionally, best practices seem to not feature at all in here.</p>

    <h3>Framework 3: Deque's Stragic Planning tool for Accessibility Prioritization</h3>

    <p>This framework is from 2016 and is hosted directly on Deque's blog, authored by Glenda Sims. It is directly addressed to clients of digital accessibility consultants, and to project managers. So it has some of the same framing problems that I brought up in the second framework I analysed.</p>

    <p>This is also set up as a map, but this one has two axis. Front and center in the chart is 'User Impact.' This is a relief to see. One big departure from the other prioritization matrix is that it emphasizes that number of users impacted doesn't not really matter when it comes to factoring in litigation risk. A single user can issue a lawsuit. In this framing, user impact specifically refers to the amount of interference that it can potentially bring on a single user. The second axis of the chart is 'Litigation risk' and refers directly to the law. Unsure about how this can be fully separate from User Impact: most lawsuits need to have some form of User Impact situation happening in order for a lawsuit to even be brought to relevancy.</p>

    <p>Two additional factors play a smaller role, but actually aren't positioned on the chart. They are annotated in the margins: Product Lifecycle and Remediation Cost. I like that these instances are not considered front and center, but they are included for pragmatism. The consideration of the product's lifecycle is new to me: It makes sense to not fix something that has plans to be retired anyway. It is also easier to catch things that are younger in the lifecycle, that are in the first stages of development (shifting left).</p>

    <h3>
      Closing Thoughts
    </h3>
    <p>I didn't end up drafting a tier list today. The biggest takeaway I have from this small dive is that it is better to assess against user flows than outright declare some WCAG criteria to be more universally of higher priority than others, with the exception of the four non-interference criteria. Additionally, I learned that supporting my client through articulating the priority of certain issues is essential to making my advice actually getting implemented. It is an essential communication tool, and will be very valuable in high-volume projects.</p>

    <p>This whole discussion also brings up a larger question: How do we get companies and web devs to bring in best practices outside of WCAG and to care about things without really zooming in on the legal issues?</p>

    <h2 id="note-5">New info from Eric Eggert's Blog</h2>
    <p>Noted September 19, 2024</p>

    <p>I'm going to be jumping around Eric's website today making some brief notes on a selection of his articles.</p>

    <p>1. <a href="https://yatil.net/blog/wcags-a-and-aa-distinction-is-mostly-academic">WCAG A and AA distinction mostly academic</a></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Generally, this piece advocates for WCAG conformance reform.</li>
      <li>Reminds me of the high-urgency framework I read elsewhere: some SC truly matter more than others. Some make the thing completely unusable: Eric points these out as Audio Control, No Keyboard Trap, Three Flashes or Below Threshold, and Pause, Stop, Hide.</li>
      <li>He makes a really good point on how 1.2.5 Audio Description prerecorded is seriously weird at Level AA. Descriptive transcripts are a million times more feasible for content authors to make than Audio Description. Audio Description is great, but is extremely costly when it must be part of remedial solutions, and many orgs who do supply Audio Description do not ever have one user that makes use of it.</li>
      <li>It feels like Audio Description would be more fitting as how Sign Language interpretation is currently set out. I do think they are very similar kinds of problems, though I am unaware with all the politicking and background that made Audio Description AA in the first place.</li>
      <li>Eric's description of A as "removes many barriers for many disabled people," AA as "removes most barriers for most disabled people" and AAA as "removes additional barriers" is a good communication tool I want to deploy in the future. But also understanding some of that nuance, as well as where the formal legal structure of 'COMPY OR DIE' seems to fail. Lawsuits, as far as I understand, are aimed at specific user flows failing. And if a descriptive text transcipt is there, that user flow can still be executed. I don't see the problem otherwise.</li>
      </ul>
    <p>2. <a href="https://yatil.net/blog/the-infuriating-inefficiency-of-accessibility-audits">The infuriating inefficiency of accessibility audits</a></p>
    <ul>
      <li>One thing I have been seriously nervous about within breaking into this field is my lack of technical knowledge. Just look at this website. I write these blog posts in HTML. I would prefer to do it in markdown, but I don't know how to set up the jekyll files. I am not a software engineer: I am a critic, trained in literary crticism and textual criticism, with a healthy sample of knowing academic theories about inclusion, anti-racism, and disability justice. This article emphasizes that one doesn't need to do the work of remediation: direct that to the team who made the website. I am merely an auditor. The auditor does not go in a rip apart the bricks of the house themself. I read this article to myself and think: the tech knowledge will come. I will learn what I need to learn, the jargon I need to know, to communicate effectively and provide solutions to my clients.</li>
      <li>Eggert recommends teams to try tackling accessibility on their own using automated testing before reaching out with an accessibility consultant. Get some baseline knowledge, and learn the questions you'll need to ask. I wonder how I can support my clients to take the reigns into their own hands like this.</li>
      <li>More talking about shifting left. We need to think about a11y prior to launch. The team needs to have a toolkit in mind. It's.. kinda wild that most university settings and coding bootcamps offer very little when it comes to a11y. I'm literally not even a web developer, and I know more than you. Ridiculous! I'm thinking back to the web developer that worked with my first organization. They promised us an accessible product in their contract. This should not be acceptable at all.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>3. <a href="https://yatil.net/blog/hope-kills-you">It's the hope that kills you</a></p>
    <ul>
      <li>I've been reading a lot of articles about burnout within a11y as a field, and this is certainly not the first that mentions Mike Paciello, a once respected subject matter expert, joining a cushy position at AudioEye. They promote an overlay and they use SLAPP lawsuit to silence people who disagree with them.</li>
      <li>I have experience with burnout. I read this article and think to myself: in truth, I am a pessimist when it comes to systemic change. All of the activists that I have looked up know that the system we are all trying to build will not be enjoyed by us, but by our children, our descendents. But yet I still dream of change. Just, with very low actual expectations for what these outcomes are.</li>
      <li>Organizing is always a one step forward, two steps back orddeal. Reading Eric's article over, I sense the optism and excitement that he describes in the early years of the field, as well as that sinking feeling that capitalism is poaching and corrupting the intentions of people who started 'good.' Money is such a big deal. This is why we need more Disabled users to be our CEOs, to be subject matter experts. The state of the field is not like that right now, and Eric's comment about abled people profitting from issues facing the Disabled community is very on the ball. It almost feels like a matter analagous to the financial arguments made for restricting cultural appropriation. It also mirrors what the Deaf community says to hearing people who want to teach signed languages: Don't freaking do it. It's not yours, you don't rely on it.</li>

    <h2 id="note-4">New info from Seirdy's Best Practices 2/2</h2>
    <p>Noted September 19, 2024</p>

    <h3>On Optimization</h3>

    <p>Starting at the 'Long-page performance' section in <a href="https://seirdy.one/posts/2020/11/23/website-best-practices/#long-page-performance">Seirdy's Best Practices blog post.</a>
    
    <h4>The 'decoding' attribute</h4>

    <p>The 'decoding attribute' is proposed as an alternative to lazy loading. Last time, we learned lazy loading was not inclusive because it doesn't work well with users with poor connections, it is also disabled by some browsers. It's also a 'fingerprinting vector,' and I don't know what that means but it sounds scary. The decoding attribute only targets images. Seirdy doesn't really exploain the technicalities of why decoding is good, while lazy loading is bad. I think it lies on the network level: lazy loading actually defers networks requests, which decoding seems to have a similar effect without actually interfering with network requests themselves.</p>

    <h4>The CSS attribute 'contain'</h4>

    <p>Time to learn about CSS containment! Seirdy doesn't give me much, so I'm looking outside to other sources.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_containment/Using_CSS_containment">Documentation from Mozilla MDN</a>. It seems this article is slightly old? The next article specifies that 'strict' and 'style' have been deprecated due to lack of scope.</li>
      <li><a href="https://blogs.igalia.com/mrego/2019/01/11/an-introduction-to-css-containment/">An intoduction to CSS Containment by Rego (Igalia)</a>. In this source, the example given is really helpful. One phrasing I'm struggling to digest is 'the isolation of a subtree'but here I think 'subtree' is just a synonym for a group of elements that are related to one another somewhow, or presented as a single unit. The idea is that you bundle this up (for the computer to understand) so it can render it individually if some kind of script is applied, or some change of layout, the thing doesn't need to comb through the entire DOM to search for elements of all that class name. It only needs to target the thing that it needs to change, improving the efficiency by something like 1000% if I am correctly interpreting the numbers this example provides.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>So I understand containment, but not the property 'content-visibility.' I don't understand, if you are already using 'containment,' why would content-visibility be an issue? Here's my guess: regardless of containment, the entire DOM will be rendered through upon the first rendering of the page. 'content-visibility' will make it so that only content that is visible on the page will be rendered. This doesn't stop the entire DOM from being combed through (that would be something like "display: none;" so AT can still get access to the page's structure.It's not lazy-loading. The whole thing is, in fact, loaded. You just can't see it, so no strain is put on the GPU.</p> 
    
    <p>It's lazy-rendering.</p>
    
    <p>Seirdy notes that there is no harm in including this, it's a progressive enhancement feature. that older browsers will simply ignore. But they also include a lot of stuff about the 'contain-intinsic-size' property, which I have tried to understand and can't understand yet.</p>

    <h4>Why is Optimization an Accesibility issue?</h4>

    <p>Seirdly links to this amazing slide deck by Eric W Baily titled <a href="https://noti.st/ericwbailey/Yfyaxa/slides">the intersection of Performance and Accessibility</a>. This is a really nice deck because the slide deck itself is optional, everything you really need to know is in the accompanying speaker's notes, which really makes it feel like we're experience Eric's talk. But beyond the amazing design of the talk, the content really lays out what is at stake when it comes to optimization for accessibility reason. It comes down to understand the Accessibility Tree.</p>
    <p>Now. I had guessed that something like the accessibility tree existed under the hood. It makes sense that the there has to be a separate interface from the DOM itself that AT can interact with. The Accessibility tree is modeled from the DOM and can be viewed as a version of the DOM with all things that aren't essential to accessibility stripped off. This is for performance reasons, and it is what the AT interacts with.</p>
    <p>In this use case, Eric talks about a case they came across while editing where there was a very deep, nested tree of elements in order to create some kind of feature in 'settings' where users can select their preferences. The porblem is that each 'selection' was made with custom div elements, not semantic HTML. And each feature was something like 6 elements with 9 attributes and a DOM length of 3. With 66 CSS selectors containing 141 properties. In other words, it was a very heavy design.</p>
    <p>So what was the problem? It overloaded the parallel model that the accessibility tree was creating, and the screen reader technology crashed. It was entirely unusable for users of NVDIA/JAWS on Firefox.</p>
    <p>The fix? semantic HTML that reduced the amount of div nesting, taken from a project called <a href="https://scottaohara.github.io/a11y_styled_form_controls/">'a11y_styled_form_controls'</a> and visually indistinguishable from the original.</p>
    <p>With this small case study, we can see that performance is a consideration with accessibility. Seirdy often discusses very niche technology and AT when testing for performance, but this case study shows that even mainstream AT can get bogged down by too much Javascript.</p>

    <h2 id="note-3">Should Phone Numbers be in an Anchor Tag?</h2>
    <p>Noted September 18, 2024</p>
    <h3>Some Background</h3>
    <p>Specifically, I am curious about this question from the a11y point of view. A quick Google search has this <a href="https://core.fiu.edu/blog/2023/hyperlinking-phone-numbers.html">phone number hyperlink guide</a> that makes the argument: most of the userw who access your site are doing so on smartphones. Making the number a link improves usability: no need to copy and paste for the link. This seems like this would be good for accessibility. But before making conclusions, let's see what other sources say.</p>
    <h3>Source #1: Maybe Doesn't Know What He's Talking About</h3>
    <p>Google gave me a <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/cliveloseby_business-webdesign-diversity-activity-7174045480148987904-fUJt?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop">LinkedIn post that you shouldn't read</a> talking about putting an ARIA label on a phone number so that the screen reader would 'pronounce it properly' with the three digits, pause, three digits, pause, four digits. Some people in the bottom make some good arguments against this: This will not provide a ubiquitous experience around different forms of AT and already makes a unwieldly intervention on something that screen reader software and users know about and are equipped to deal with. Users can read character by character and control their own speed!. Particularly, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/matthew-putland/?originalSubdomain=au">Matthew Putland</a> pointed out that it would actually detract from the experience of braille display users of screen readers due to the way that braille itself adds number characters before numbers. Seems like this is an instance of no aria is better than bad aria, as they always say!</p> 
    <p>But this actually doesn't answer my question. What about anchor links? what about other ways we can make phone numbers accessible?</p>
    <h3>Source #2: TPGI</h3>
    <p><a href="https://www.tpgi.com/making-numbers-in-web-content-accessible/">TPGi's article</a> offers a collection of really helpful tips. They concur with Matthew Putland's assessment that aria labels should not be used to override screen reader users' preference. Also they provide a clear answer to my question: Yes! You should add an anchor element, and you should use the tel: prefix to your code.</p>
    <h3>Source #3: WCAG Supplemental</h3>
    <p>I found a note in the <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG2/supplemental/patterns/o3p06-format-punctuation/">Cognitive Accesibility note in WCAG supplementals</a> simply saying to format in number in the way your locale typically desingates phone numbers. This improves the readability for cognitively disabled folks, and improves readibility for text-to-speech voices (this is a bold claim-- where is your evidence)?</p>
    <h3>Source #4: ADA Site Compliance</h3>
    <p>We're beyond the discussion of anchor elements at this point, but while we're talking about different disability-technology interactions, here's another point that <a href="https://adasitecompliance.com/website-accessibility-for-deaf-and-hard-of-hearing/">ADA Site Compliance</a> makes: Don't only have a phone number listed in your contacts. Some people don't want to use the phone! The article lists Deaf/Hard-of-Hearing/late-deafened people as the target for such an intervention, but I can list so many more. Social anxiety! Those who can't use their voice! People who have trouble articulating sounds well! Auditory processing disorders! I can't understate social anxiety! This is a super great, and perhaps only tacitly related point, but it's an important one.</p>

    <h3>In Summary</h3>
    <p>I was worried that anchored telephone numbers would be distracting to people using things like JAWS, NVDIA, and Talk-Back. I saw no accounts of such a phenomenon, but learned some other key things instead:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Don't put an ARIA label on a phone number.</li>
      <li>Make sure to format it to your locale's standard formatting.</li>
      <li>Don't forget the 'tel' prefix in your href!</li>
      <li>Ensure you have alternative ways for clients to contact you besides just the phone number.</li>
    </ul>

      Concerning PDFs
    </h2>
    <p>Noted September 18, 2024</p>
    <p>I currently know very little about nearly all aspects of PDF accessibility, so today I will ask a question to myself and answer it.</p>
    <dl>
      <dt>Under legislated WCAG 2.1 and under the AMA, is it required to have all PDF documents acceptable? For example: would it be enough to simply indicate that plain-text versions of the PDF are available? Would a plaintext document be considered a replacement for this?</dt>
      <dd>Preliminarily, ChatGPT tells me the company is liable. What about links to external PDFs, where is the line drawn? Time to read <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG-TECHS/pdf.html">PDF techniques from W3C</a>. Apparently something called PDF/UA, guidelines released in 2012, is applicable here? Now taking a look at this <a href="https://boutonjones.com/pub/a11y/a11y_accessu_2024_pdf101_handout.pdf">slide deck from a subject matter expert</a>. Ironically it's a PDF. Key takeaways from this: in America, inaccessible PDFs have been the subject of Section 508 lawsuits. Additionally, 'tagged PDFs' are considered the only PDFs with the potential to be accessible.</dd>
      </dt>
    </dl>
    <p><a href="https://boutonjones.com/pub/a11y/a11y_accessu_2024_pdf101_handout.pdf">The PDF slide deck</a> is a goldmine. Here's another thing to learn: if you 'Print to PDF' (as I often DO!) the resulting product will be stripped of all semantic markup, all tags, with the weird exception of tables. It makes sense, table behaviour can never not be weird.</p>
    <p>More gems from the slide deck:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Microsoft Word, you will have to manually select the document language in order for that to be in the markup. I wonder if this would have progressed at ALL with the development of some of these interfaces. It seems reasonable that this can be done automatically. What is to be done with billingual documents? Unsure if there is the availability to but lang attributes on different sections within most word processors.</li>
      <li>Table of contents are highly recommended. They can be generated automatically if you already have semantic markup and I do do this frequently. However: I am curious about the styling. The very common Table of Contents styles has a lot of leading periods before the page number. This doesn't seem screen-reader friendly. Maybe it generates it automatically with ARIA that ignores it? Do PDFs have ARIA? Googling has no good answer to this.</li>
      <li>Another advice is not to use tables for layout. Okay. Then how? Also, I am pretty sure that the PDF that initially triggered this whole fiasco for me was created in Microsoft Publisher. Are they even publishing publisher? Has Publisher been unpublished?</li>
      <li>For data, column headers in tables are apparently a nightmare.</li>
      <li>In popular word processors, if alt text is left blank, is it marked as decorative or will it lack the alt attribute? I will need to test this by myself maybe.</li>
      <li>Word art and text boxes are not accessible, apparently. Why aren't text boxes accessible?</li>
      <li>Additionally. Did AI change the landscape on PDF accessibility? Not that it matters truly-- many users will not have access to AI and we have to cater to the most janky setup to priotize truly inclusive design. </li>
      <li>A major take-away from this slide deck is that working within the word processor is a million times better than taking a pdf and trying to remediate it using Acrobat. I do not even have acrobat. My clients will likely not have it either, nor have the technical expertise to do this write! It is easy enough to teach how to do semantic markup. Again, it's always about building a culture of accessibility-- and remediation seems like the solution that just accepts innaccessible production as a given.</li>
      <li>New topic: bookmarks. Bookmarks should mirror headings (are they just another form of semantic markup?) In word we can do this on exprt by saying 'create bookmarks using headings' (I wonder what the Doc equivelant is...)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Bouton emphasizes that we should be first asking the question: is a PDF the best way to accomplish what we need?</p>
    <h3>Personal Reflection</h3>
    <p>I am thinking back to the time I spent at my former workplace and the amount of PDFs that we generated on a daily basis to throw up on our website. We did it so much and I'm sure we're not alone.</p>
    <p>I don't know why I though PDFs were exempt from WCAG. It's obvious in hindsight. I think I didn't know enough about PDFs to understand even the beginning of how they can be made accessible. But it comes down to semantic markup, as it always does. I shouldn't be surprised.</p>
    <p>I need to get into the habit of making accessible PDFs in my personal life as well.</p>
    <p>Ironically, I often read PDFs with a text-to-speech engine. And I understand where all the bullshit comes in, I've just never considered that there might be fixes to this. If only all the headers were marked, semantically as headers!</p>
    <p>Another big consideration here is that a lot of PDF content I read are scans of content, or instances where the PDF was not meant to be consumed on a device.A lot of this content is done by volunteers who are simply going for quantity over quality. But there are bigger problems that those specific sites have to worry about, legally, than accessibility lawsuits.</p>

    <h2 id="note-1">New info from Seirdy's Best Practices 1/2</h2>
    <p>Noted around September 16, 2024</p>
    <p><a href="https://seirdy.one/posts/2020/11/23/website-best-practices/">Seirdy's Best Practices guide</a> is the blog post in question.</p>
    <p>'Maximally inclusive' as catering to the edge case, niche browsers, old browsers. What possible kinds of users are there? Inclusivity goes beyond accessibility: language barriers, class barriers.</p>
    <p>Questions about things I don't understand:</p>
    <dl>
      <dt>What is TLS?</dt>
      <dd>According to Wikipedia, it stands for Transport Layer Security and it secures the HTTP protocol. I need to ask about the scope of this one is in particular, I know very little about cybersecurity.</dd>

      <dt>When Seirdy talks about not relying on scripts, are they talking about literally all Javascript? Probably...</dt>
      <dd>According to Copilot, Seirdy's referring to client-side scripts, which is basically just Javascript. PHP doesn't count because it's server-side. As for what popular things rely on scripts, dynamic content loading, animations, interactive forms, real-time updates, media controls, and e-commmerce things are all Javascript things.</dd>

      <dt>What does the cache have?</dt>
      <dd>A cache is a folder held in your version of the browser you are using. It stores it in there to allow faster reloaded of key assets. I didn't understand how it could be stored 'on the device' before-- but it does this by storing in itself. How does Firefox get stored on your computer? Firefox's cache is in the same folder.</dd>


      <dt>What does it mean to be a 'blocking' resource?</dt>
      <dd>A resource that can cause the website to be blank, even if most things get loaded correctly. A blocked resource effectively makes it so that this doesn't mean anything. </dd>


      <dt>What is 'semantically-meaningful compressed markup?</dt>
      <dd>Googling this combination of words only brings up Seirdy's article. </dd>

      <dt>What is 'lazy loading?'</dt>
      <dd>When the page loads things only as needed. This is most used for pages that have lots of javascript.</dd>

      <dt>What is 'infinite scolling?'</dt>
      <dd>So this is when the content comes from the bottom endlessly. Like TikTok! Actually not like TikTok, but this is how I'll be thinking about it. Particularly, it makes footers difficult to reach for AT users.</dd>

    <p>Seirdy makes a great point that an overloaded CPU means that speech synthesis might be thin. I expect it's similar for voice-controlled contol, eye-control (like with a Tobi). They make a lot of hemming and hawing about the importance of quick and efficient asset loading and I don't think I appreciated this section until they made that comment. In this case, ease of loading is an inclusivity issue.</p>

    <p>Seirdy talks a lot about 'user flows' as being a more accurate framework than 'page weight.' But I want to learn about the latter before appreciating the former, so let's go on a-- it's REALLY JUST the AMOUNT OF BYTES??!??!</p>

    <p>Page weight is considered a speed metric, maybe. But Seirdy's framing puts these bytes into context (user interaction and goal). I wonder why bytes wouldn't be a good assesment, aren't bytes bytes? </p>
