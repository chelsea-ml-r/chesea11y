1 Introduction
liberal democracies => robust disability laws? not so..
perhaps we have to take a more agentive approach, because the systemic approach to diffusion seems insufficient. 
exclusion through environmental barriers are inherently special to disability as a discrimination category
'reasonable accomodation' (note the qualifier)
mobilizing disabled people is hard due to lack of consistant self-identification
------

2 Explaining the Spread of Rights
traditional explanations for diffusion:
  coercion (material, military), persuasion (logic of appropriateness), learning (conditional on ideology, active engagement), emulation (more passive than learning, just downloading stuff)
why this might not work
  too top down and doesn't really take in agentive change
  assumes that the most powerful will have the most just norms (vsv appropriateness)

Framing: what agents choose to do in light of the information that they have

Rights are socially constructed and interpreted variously
potentially domestic landscapes are more important than international

3 Disability Rights in Europe

paradigm shift: human rights perspective a recent one; prior considered a social security, welfare, health, or charity issue that should be segregated

social model accompanied by rise of commmunity living movement

let's step back for a second and really acknoledge how new the crpd 

disability discrimination legislation varies quite widely in how comprehensive it is

the author asks us to question our conception of what kinds of states consent to these laws

4 Case Studies

  A. Denmark

  a 'laggard?' compared to its neighbours
  denmark early adopter of human rights policies

  only 2004 when anti-discrimination was introduced, and only within the EU framework
  they viewed the anti-discrimination policies as an 'american' model that mandated individual disabled people to sue for their rights to be ensured, preferred to work in a more representational framework, which they viewed as a model of inclusion. 
  <blockquote>
  that legislation that establishes rights is irreconcilable with methods of cooperation that can result in the implementation of concrete measures for people with disabillities
  <blockquote></blockquote>

  B. Cyprus

5. Conclusion
