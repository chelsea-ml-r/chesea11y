        exploring alternative paradigms to the accessibility professional

        problems with the current paradigm: 1. saviourist 2.divorced from larger conversations about disability liberation 3.purely rooted in the functional definition of disability 3.easier to exceed in as an able-bodied person than a disabled person 4.unable to see the self in the problem
        5. cop-culture based vs care-culture based

        1. that which is being saved
        2. platformer of conversations
        3. able to see the fialing of the functional model
        4.
