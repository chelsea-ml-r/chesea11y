            <h1>Um Actually, You Don't *Need* A Transcript</h1>
            <p>Composed Wednesday, January 22, 2025</p>
            <p>Or alternatively, "The Way WCAG Structures Success Criteria for Accessible Synchronized Audiovisual Media Makes No Sense."</p><p> In this article, we discuss what it takes to for synchronized media to be WCAG-conformant at Levels A and AA, how WCAG's approach incentivizes inaccessibility for DeafBlind people, and how countries around the world with digital accessibility standards have legislated exceptions to circumvent this.</p>

            <hr>
            <p>A user posed a question to the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/WCAGa11y/posts/1986992445120713/">WCAG A11y Professionals Facebook group</a> regarding whether fully captioned pieces of multimedia also <strong>needed</strong> to be supplied with a transcript. The few voices that chimed in responded enthusiastically that a transcript was indeed <strong>required</strong>.</p>
            <p>I'm surprised that nobody challenged this. According to WCAG, depending on the circumstances, you may not actually <strong>require</strong> one. But before we get into the technicalities and decision trees, a small disclaimer and definition of terms.</p>

            <h2>Have a Transcript Anyway</h2>

            <h3>People Rely on Them</h3>

            <p>Descriptive transcripts are the only reliable way for <a href="https://lithub.com/john-lee-clark-on-why-capitalization-matters-to-the-deafblind-community/">DeafBlind</a> people with high hearing and vision loss to access audiovisual media.</p>
            <p>Descriptive transcripts are also the only way for Blind people to access audiovisual media delivered in languages they do not understand. </p>
            
            <section class="example">
                <p>For example, a Thai-speaking Blind person may be able to access the enormously popular Korean-language Netflix show <em>Squid Game</em>. They won't be able to read the subtitles, but <em>Squid Game</em> has an enormous internationalization budget and it is dubbed in Thai and has Thai audio description. </p>
                <p>For a smaller Netflix show like <em>Inside Job</em>, they would have to rely on a descriptive transcript. As is the case for most shows on Netflix, <em>Inside Job</em> has no Thai dub or audio description. </p><p>Except Netflix doesn't provide descriptive transcripts, so they would just be blocked entirely, just like a good portion of the DeafBlind population.</p>
            </section>
            <p>Captions are not a substitute for descriptive transcripts, for three reasons:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>No description of visual things</strong>. Additionally, most caption authors assume that you can see who's talking and only annotate the sources of voices that are offscreen.</li>
                <li><strong>Not easily downloadable</strong>. You can't even download caption files off of YouTube without reaching for some sketchy workarounds.</li>
                <li><strong>Not meant for human consumption</strong>. Caption files contain a lot of metadata and code meant for the computer. Especially if you're consuming them in a linear reading mode like Braille where you can't visually filter out where the actually captioned text is, you are likely going to mostly be reading numbers and tags. <a href="https://matesub.com/resources/subtitle-file-formats">Matesub</a> compares the underlying code of various caption formats so you can imagine how difficult it would be to parse through some of these. </li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Everyone Benefits From Them</h3>
            <p>Transcripts are good for SEO. They are a driver of efficiency, being faster to consume than the video itself.</p>
            <p>If you have an existing caption file, transcripts are relatively easy to prepare. Unlike audio-description, which must deal with the unique challenge of succinctly providing visual context in the time-constrained pauses between spoken dialogue, transcripts have no time limit and can provide more comprehensive descriptions.</p>
            <h3>So Have a Transcript Anyway</h3>
            <p>My intention in writing this article is not to discourage the use of transcripts, but to point out what I view to be a major flaw in WCAG 2.X. <strong>If your audiovisual media does not have a descriptive transcript</strong>, regardless of whether it is conformant to WCAG, it is my belief that <strong>your product is not accessible</strong>.</p>
            <p>Most entities aiming for WCAG 2.X Level AA will have captions on all their audiovisual media. It does not take an enormous amount of effort and resources to transform those captions into a transcript format or to a descriptive transcript format.</p>

            <p>Now, let's talk about how they aren't necessary for conformance to WCAG 2.X Level AA.</p>

            <h2 id="primary-argument">Transcripts in WCAG 2.X</h2>

            <p>A small note before we begin-- I say 'transcripts' but our scope is restricted to addressing descriptive transcripts for <strong>prerecorded audiovisual media</strong>. Audio-only media must have a transcript according to <a href="">SC 1.2.1 Audio-only and Video-only (Prerecorded)</a>.</p>

            <h3>Examining The Criteria in Question as a Bad Faith Actor</h3>

            <h4>Introducing Peter</h4>

            <p>Let's pretend that <strong>Perniciously Pragmatic Peter</strong> is reviewing the WCAG documentation. Perniciously Pragmatic Peter is overseeing the accessibility efforts of his company and is aiming to create an implementation that meets the bar and goes absolutely no further.</p>
            <p>Perniciously Pragmatic Peter is always going to select the most cost-effective implementation. He doesn't care about maximizing gains from the accessibility program. He sees no value from adding accessibility into the company except decreasing legal risk.</p>
            <p>Perniciously Pragmatic Peter isn't malicious, he's just doing business as he's always done for the past thirty five years. At the end of the day, he's going back to wife, adult children and golfing club. He doesn't have many Disabled people in his life, with the exception of his aging father (who doesn't use technology anyways).</p>

            <p>Let's see how Perniciously Pragmatic Peter would operate given different conformance models.</p>

            

            <h4>Level A</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#captions-prerecorded">SC 1.2.2 Captions (Prerecorded)</a>. All prerecorded audiovisual media must be provided with captions.</li>
                <li><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#audio-description-or-media-alternative-prerecorded">SC 1.2.3 Audio Description or Media Alternative (Prerecorded)</a>. All prerecorded audiovisual media must have <strong>either</strong> a transcript, or audio description.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>If Level A was the bar Perniciously Pragmatic Peter had to meet, Peter is going to direct his team to make captions for all of his audiovisual media and use those caption files to make a transcript.</p>
            <p>He is not going to even consider audio description. For even small products, between the script-writing, voice talent, editing and timing, the cost of procurring audio description can easily break the 100-dollar mark.</p>
            <p>In 2025, more and more companies are reaching for captions generated by AI. The output is far from being 100% there, but add a human editor with the right training and you can get very decent captions for far cheaper than has historically been possible.</p><p> The cost to transform captions into a descriptive transcript is also minimal, requiring another human editor with the right training to review what visual elements need to be included and to format the document appropriately.</p>

            <h5>At Level A, Peter procures:</h5>
            <ul>
                <li>Closed Captioning.</li>
                <li>Descriptive Transcript.</li>
                <li>No Audio Description.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Level AA</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#audio-description-prerecorded">SC 1.2.5 Audio Description (Prerecorded).</a> All prerecorded media must have audio description.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The reality is that in most jurisdictions, Perniciously Pragmatic Peter is not going to be aiming for Level A. Most legislation including Section 508 and the EAA's standard, EN 301 549, require one to target Level AA conformance, where audio descriptions are necessary.</p>
            <p>If Level AA was the bar Perniciously Pragmatic Peter had to meet, Peter is not going to produce a descriptive transcript in order to meet <em>SC 1.2.3 Audio Description or Media Alternative (Prerecorded)</em> because he already will be procuring audio description to meet SC 1.2.5 and Level AA. And in getting audio description to meet SC 1.2.5, he meets SC 1.2.3.</p>

            <p>At Level AA, given that you've already incorporated audio description, producing a basic descriptive transcript is even easier to do. Simply smash your caption file and your audio description script together, clean up the formatting, and you have a descriptive transcript. </p><p>Perniciously Pragmatic Peter, however, sees no reason to do this. He has met the requirements and he feels absolute no reason to go any further than this.</p>

            <h5>At Level AA, Peter procures:</h5>
            <ul>
                <li>Closed Captioning.</li>
                <li>Audio Description.</li>
                <li>No Descriptive Transcript.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>This is Regression</h3>
            <p>Descriptive transcripts provide access to a larger population than audio description does. DeafBlind people are actually less likely to be able to access the content of audiovisual media from companies conforming to Level AA, than from companies who are targetting Level A.</p>
            <p>This mirrors how things have been done in broadcasting. DeafBlind people have long been excluded by traditional broadcasting entertainment. While Blind and Deaf persons may rely on audio description and captioning (that programs must provide as required by federal regulation), there has historically been no way for transcripts to be served over the TV and DeafBlind people continue to be locked out of this domain.</p>
            <p>The web provides an opportunity for that norm to be changed but WCAG instead recreates the conditions that allow DeafBlind people to fall through the gap.</p>
            <p>Several jurisdictions have recognized SC 1.2.5 as being somehow problematic and have included exceptions in their laws regarding SC 1.2.5. Let's see how Perniciously Pragmatic Peter responds in these various jurisdictions.</p>

            <p>3.

            <h4>Level AAA</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#media-alternative-prerecorded">SC 1.2.8 Media Alternative (Prerecorded)</a>. All prerecorded media must have a transcript.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <p>Level AAA is beyond the scope of the conformance model. Level AAA also positions itself as containing success criteria that are unrealistic to achieve. The inclusion of descriptive transcripts as a Level AAA criterion gives the impression that completing it is unnecessary, that nobody is expecting you to complete it because it requires so much to additional effort to actually execute.</p>

            <p>However, this impression of a massive amount of additional effort is completely misguided.</p>

            <p>A website that meets Level AA already has all the content required of a descriptive transcript. Simply format the text from the caption file and the text from the audio description alongside one another in a single document. You have a descriptive transcript!</p>

            <h3>Fallen Through the Cracks</h3>

            <p>For organizations only interested in accessibility for the legal implications, providing only audio description is a very practical choice. Most legal frameworks rely on WCAG 2.X Level AA, and that is what most organizations also target.</p>

            <p>Satisfying 'Audio Description (Prerecorded)' immediatly satifies 'Audio Description or Media Alternative (Prerecorded).' By classifying Media Alternative (Prerecorded), you're giving the false impression that a transcript is super hard to make.</p>



            <p>.</p>
