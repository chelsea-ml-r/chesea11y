            <h1>What Kind of Disabled Are You?</h1>
            <p>Composed Sunday, February 16, 2025</p>

            <hr>
            <h2>Preface</h2>
            <p>"What kind of Disabled are you" is not a question that should be levelled at anyone, especially if you are not Disabled and asking it to someone new who is.</p>
            <p>But it is a question that I recently have been asking myself. While I don't believe that self-disclosure of diagnosis should become a widespread practice, I think I owe it to my fellow Disabled practitioners in accessibility, or anyone Disabled who happens upon this blog, to clarify some details about my self-identification and journey. This is especially because there are many places in this blog where I use my Disabled identity as an indicator of some kind of authority.</p>
            <p>I am also not opposed to sharing about my journey here. This is not a blog that I anticipate will become my full front-facing professional persona. I retain a degree of anonymity, and I think the details could be helpful to another person in a similar situation.</p>
            <p>Because once something's out there, you can never really take it back.</p>

            <h2>The Disclosure</h2>
            <p>Enough suspense. I have HMO, or multiple hereditary osteochondromas, or multiple hereditary exostoses, or MHO, or HME, or MHE. It's rare enough that they can't agree on a name.</p><p> I like 'HMO' because I am also queer (big surprise).</p><p> HMO folks have bumpy bones. A bunch of benign tumours all over the skeleton that restrict movement alongside causing pain and fatigue. My parents tell me I was diagnosed at three years old. My first X-ray revealed bumps on my ribcage "as multitudinous as the stars." Through surgery, I have gotten rid of the tumours that caused movement restrictions. I still get mega fatigue.<p>
            <p>It was pretty disruptive throughout my childhood. Things have since changed. You can no longer tell by just looking at me. I used to have a cane on me at all times, either in my hand or folded up in my bag. I have not used such a cane in three years. I could have went cane-less and crutch-less much sooner, except I went through a lot of medical gaslighting through my youth that basically forced me to deal with all of the symptoms on my own with zero intervention.</p>
            <p>The medical gaslighting was so bad that I didn't even link my own mobility issues with the HMO diagnosis until I was an adult. I was convinced that I was faking it, or the unfortunate victim of some unsolvable plague, by all the adults around me.</p>
            <p>I have also been diagnosed with a few mental illnesses (I don't think I am obliged to say which) that still interfere with my everyday, but they used to be worse in childhood. While I don't have an official diagnosis for any cognitive conditions, the mechanism underlying HMO (heparan sulfate deficiency) is speculated to cause "autism-like" behaviour, and I have been peer-diagnosed several times, including by my own therapist. The waitlist to get an actual diagnosis through the public medical system is over two years long.</p>

            <h2>Everything Was Worse in Childhood</h2>
            <p>This is the reason why I felt the need to make this post and this disclosure. As an adult, I have not really had to struggle for access in the same way I did as a child.</p>
            <p>But as a child, I had no political awareness or identity as a Disabled person. My political awareness and Disabled identity were formed retrospectively after the storm had subsided. </p><p>This has caused a fundamental contradiction at the heart of all the activism I do. I used to struggle massively if a door couldn't open automatically. I can now open it with ease, but I still sometimes talk like I'm my past self.</p>
            <p>The past is incredibly sticky. And like some horrific goo, it is surprisingly malleable. The authority I derive from my traumatic memories carries more reliability than a person who just dreams up whatever scenario, or participates in a "disability simulator" (don't even get me started), but it is not on the same level as a person giving live testimony from what it is like to be physically Disabled person today experiencing perpetual access barriers.</p>

            <h2>What Kind of Disabled Am I?</h2>
            <p>I've had a very unique journey. The kind of Disabled person I am has changed throughout my life, just as the kinds of disabilities I am impacted by day-to-day have also changed.</p>
            <p>I am still coming to terms with my own neurodivergencies, as well as fully recognizing the extent to which my mental illnesses impact me.</p>
