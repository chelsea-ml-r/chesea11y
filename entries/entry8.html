            <dl class="books">
                <dt>You Look Like a Thing and I Love You</dt>
                <dd>Janelle Shane. Nonfiction. Approachable and whimsical tutorial discussing strengths and weaknesses of AI. Managed to balance technical material with candid explanations in a way that would be successful even with non-technical audiences. It needs a second edition, as doesn't accurately combat the current narratives around AI made mainstream during the recent AI explosion. 4/5.</dd>
                <dt>Careless People</dt>
                <dd>Sarah Wynn-Williams. Nonfiction/Exposee/Life Writing. Facebook and Facebook's leadership are woefully careless, self-centred people, that do not care for anyone who they consider to be below them. Even the author doesn't come out looking great. I would encourage anyone to read the chapter about Myanmar. The story's outrage is propelled mostly through characterization of known figures, but I would have like to see another chapter or two written more in the style of the Myanmar chapter, where the main speaker is less present and research and global timelines instead are the main consideration. An utter page turner constructed beautifully to deliver the thesis. 5/5.</dd>
                <dt>How to Keep House While Drowning</dt>
                <dd>KC Davis. Nonfiction/Self-Help/Life Writing. Extremely vulnerable portrait of what can happen if you don't uncouple 'keeping house' with your worth as a good person. Writer hasn't reached much outside of herself for this one, and I think the text could have benefited from field research, especially if the aim was to appeal to a large range of neurotypes that might benefit from applications of the text. 3.5/5.</dd>
                <dt>The Good Enough Job</dt>
                <dd>Simone Stolzoff. Nonfiction. Good takeaways about the need to divorce work from self-worth and how doing that requires an incredible amount of deliberate actions to undue the system of value based around "resume virtues." Ultimately jobs need to only give you enough money to live, so define that early and go from there. Convincingly written. 4.5/5. </dd>
                <dt>Iron Widow</dt>
                <dd>Xiran Jay Zhao. Science Fiction/Fantasy. Good historical background and worldbuilding, characters were not as convincing. 3.5/5.</dd>
