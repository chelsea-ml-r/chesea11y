            <h1>My CPACC Experience</h1>

            <p>Preemptively creating this page so I have some clarity.</p>
            <h2>technical details</h2>
            <p>inadequacy of the body of knowledge</p>
            <ul>
                <li>there's lot of broken links</li>
                <li>there's lots of material linked that isn't itself accessible</li>
                <li>there is some bad information</li>
                <li>questions on the amount of depth required and expectations set
                    <ul>
                        <li>if it's in the Body of knowledge, are we expected to cough it up?</li>
                        <li>personally feel the scope of recommended study tasks needs to be better defined</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>misdirected focus</p>
            <ul>
                <li>i think the legislation portion needs to be more pattern oriented. being regional doesn't really help, and also guarantees that the test is western-hemisphere oriented
                    <ul>
                        <li>it's already kind of trying to do this, but the chapter headings don't support this kind of synthesis</li>
                        <li>burying all the asian legislation doesn't help either.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>we could use a little bit of disability history in here. we learn a little but we could learn more to gain an appreciation and sense for how the accessibility field is built off the back of Disabled people advocating for their rights</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>emotional details</h2>
            <p>exam sign up details and execution, financial barriers.</p>
            <p>a lot of this information is stuff that disabled people already intuitively know. and this kinda feels like a certification that ableds can get that puts their expertise over disabled people who can't otherwise access the cert for reasons financial or otherwise.</p>
