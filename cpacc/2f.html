            <h1 id="2f">2F. Principles of UD for Learning</h1>
            <p>We were exposed to UDL on Day 10 when we saw an instructor from the University of Washington opine about how UDL, UD and WCAG are often not considered in tandem. Let's try to understand what makes UDL antagonistic to UD and WCAG, and whether this is actually the case.</p>

      <h2>Source: Body of Knowledge</h2>
      <p>There are three principles to the UDL. They come from the field of cognitive science and are centered on the 'why', the 'what' and the 'how' of learning.</p>
      <h3>Why Learn?</h3>
      <p>Multiple means of engagement addresses diversity in learner motivation, sustained engagement, and coping skills. Provide options in all three areas.</p>
      <p>For example, provide options along the spectrums of spontaneity to routine, groupwork to solowork.</p>

      <h3>Learn What?</h3>
      <p>Multiple means of representation adresses diversity in preferred learning modality: consider visual, textual, tactile, auditory modes, consider language/symbol use, consider information hierarchy.</p>
      <p>For example, EAL learners or Disabled learners might be restricted in what modes are effective.</p>

      <h3>Learn How?</h3>
      <p>Multiple means of action and expression adresses diversity in the kinds of assignments and tasks that diverse people will prefer. This principle also encompasses the accessibility of the learning environment.</p>
      <p>For example, people might prefer written assignments, other people might prefer presentations.</p>

      <h2>Source: <a href="https://udlguidelines.cast.org/">CAST, UDL Guidelines</a></h2>
      <p>The UDL Guidelines are structures like the WCAG. There are various 'considerations' (their version of success criteria) under nine guidelines.</p>
      <p>However, I actually can't tackle this nine guidelines today, because I don't know which version the exam is going to test on. They recently updated to version 3.0 of the UDLG, but the Body of Knowledge bases itself on the 2.2. I'm going to pause and wait to see what the A11Y slack says before proceeding.</p>

            <p>I received confirmation that the 2.2 version, not the 3.0 version, is the one that the exam was written up about. I'm going to quickly memorize all of them today. I'm going to over-memorize the points. The BoK lists nine data points; three going to each of the three overall principles: multiple means of representation, multiple means of action and expression, and multiple means of engagement. But each of these nine points actually have something like three to four criteria under them. Thirty-one, to be exact. Thirty one + nine + three is 43 data points, which is almost as big as WCAG Level AA.</p>
            <p>I'm endeavoring to commit all of these to memory not because of the CPACC, but because I am (in my third job) a teacher, and my day job is in education support. So this is important to me. Let's get started.</p>

Unsure about the accessibility of quizlet, but it is what works for me. I learn better with numbers, its just a more abstract way to mind map.</p>
      
            <p>All of the immediate subnodes are worded with 'provide options for.'</p>

            <p>After three hours of studying with by mapping, using the graphic organizer and drudging through flashcards, I've gotten most of it done. I'm going to preemptively try to cough it up and see what I fail on.</p>

            <p>Let's check my answers!</p>
            <p>The exacting wording is often variable, but most capture the spirit of the original UDLG. Data point 2.5 was written as 'Illustrate using images,' when it should have been 'Illustrate using media.'</p>
            <p>3.4 (Maximize transfer and generalization), 8.2 (Vary resources and demands to optimize challenges), and 8.4 (Provide feedback for mastery) were the only three that were outright missed.</p>
