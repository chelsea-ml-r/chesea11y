            <h1>Logistical Details for CPACC</h1>
            <p>Here I'll go over some information if you're interested in hearing more about the sign-up process.</p>

            <h2>IAAP Membership</h2>
            <p>You do not need to be an IAAP member to take the CPACC. I decided to not become a member because it makes little financial sense for me to do so at this point of my life. Doing so however, you get access to the following benefits relevant to the exam:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Access to the Princeton CPACC Prep Course</li>
                <li>$100 Discount on the exam</li>
            </ul>
            <p>If you are a full-time university student, go for the membership. At the time of writing, (February 2025), the membership price is $65, the discount is $100, so it's effectively a $35 discount on the exam, and you get IAAP membership for a year. </p>
            <p>Also note that you must have a membership prior to signing up for your exam in order to qualify for the discount.</p>

            <h2>Membership Account</h2>
            <p>You need to first create an account on the <a href="https://certification.accessibilityassociation.org/s/">Examination portal</a>. You will not be able to sign up for an exam until the sign-up period is open. Check the <a href="https://www.accessibilityassociation.org/s/certification-apply">Exam Dates</a> page to figure out when that is, typically it's about a month and four days prior to the last possible exam date.</p>

            <h2>Sign Up For the Exam</h2>
            <p>Fill out an exam application on the Certification Portal when the Exam registration period opens. You will be asked for your current job title, and for some details regarding your experience in the field. If you have more than a year of experience, you don't have to submit any other clarifying details.</p>
            <p>You must choose between an in-person or online proctored exam at this stage.</p>
            <p>You will also be asked if you require any accommodations at this stage.</p>
            <p>It also asks for your legal name here. My legal name and chosen name differ, so I provided my legal name at this stage.</p>

            <h2>Confirmation</h2>
            <p>My application was processed after about a week.</p>

            <h2>Payment</h2>
            <p>You can pay directly via credit card, or arrange to receive an invoice.</p>

            <h2>Scheduling with Pearson</h2>
            <p>You will be directed to sign up with Pearson VUE. Scheduling an exam with them will require your legal name. Somehow, my chosen name, not my legal name, was sent to Pearson. I had to send an extra email to get that corrected.</p>
