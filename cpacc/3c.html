                <h3 id="US">US: Americans with Disabilities Act (1990)</h3>


                <p>The ADA puts anti-discrimination protections in place for disability status. </p><p>The preamble to the ADA, which the Body of Knowledge quotes at length, notes that Disabled people have traditionally had no redress against discrimination that has been exercized against them, resulting in many Disabled people being segregated and exposed to constant exclusion from public spaces and opportunities. </p><p>It ends by noting that the dependency and non-productivity of Disabled people costs the United States 'billions of dollars in unnecessary expenses.' The argument here is not just moral or on the basis of human rights; it is an economic argument.</p>
                <p>According to the <a href="https://adata.org/learn-about-ada">ADA National Network</a> (linked to from the Body of Knowledge), the ADA is organized into five sections, or 'Titles'.</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Title I deals with establishing Equal Employment opportunity</li>
                  <li>Title II deals with Nondiscrimination in State and Local Government Services. It deals mostly with accessible public transportation</li>
                  <li>Title III deals with Nondiscrimination in Public Accomodations and Commercial Facilities</li>
                  <li>Title IV deals with Telecommunications, that people with auditory and speech disabilities can still use them and ensures state announcements get captioned</li>
                  <li>Title V covers Miscellaneous topics</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The ADA was ammended in 2008 following a bunch of lawsuits that kept on restricting the definition of what it meant to be disabled. The power of the ADA had been drastically weakened. The ADAAAA (the ADA Ammendments Act) made the definition more flexible again.</p>
          
          
          

                <h3 id="Ontario">Canada: Ontarians with Disabilities Act (2001)</h3>

                <p>Don't mistake this with the Accessibility for Ontarians with Disabilities Act (AODA). The Ontarians with Disabilities Act or the ODA was released in 2001 and affirms the right of Disabled people in the province of Ontario to equal opportunity and to be free from discrimination.</p>
                <p>The Body of Knowledge links directly to <a href="https://www.ontario.ca/laws/statute/01o32">the full text of the ODA.</a></p>
                <p>It prescribes that educational institutions and hospitals, public transporation organization, and government buildings be accessible.</p>
                <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accessibility_for_Ontarians_with_Disabilities_Act,_2005">Wikipedia's article on the AODA</a> mentions that this was quite a weak piece of legislation as it had literally no enforcement, penalties or deadlines. Though they also mention that the ODA mandated that all provincial websites be made accessible by 2002, which is a little 'before-its-time.' This act certainly paved a way for its successor, the AODA, which was much more comprehensive (though we've yet to see how successful it truly will be. See <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/ontario-aodoa-deadline-1.7412706">"Ontario was supposed to be accessible by 2025" by CBC News</a>).</p>

            <h3 id="EU">Countries in the EU: Harmonized Standards?</h3>

                <p>In terms of employing an approach for 'reasonable acommodation,' all EU member states employ laws based on the Employment Equality Directive, passed in 2000, that requires reasonable accommodation for people with disabilities in the realm of the employment.</p>
                <p>However, the Anti-Discrimination Directive proposed in 2008, that would have expanded reasonable accommodation into all domains, has not been adopted. Country to country, different countries have different policies that apply to different domains of life. Some prohibit discimination on the basis of disability, some require reasonable accommodation, some do both, and some accomplish neither.</p>
        
        

                <h3 id="Britain">UK: The Equality Act (2010)</h3>

                <p>2010 is rather recent. The Equality Act supercedes what was a bunch of disparate anti-discrimination legislation and provides a uniform complaint mechanism for all of them. All organizations are subject to the Equality Act if they are 'carrying out a public function.' </p><p>Characteristics protected by the Equality Act look a little bit different than some of the other anti-discrimination laws that we've seen, likely due to its time period. Marriage and civil partnership, pregnancy and maturity, and gender reassignment are characterics alongside more traditional ones like age, race, religion, sexual orientation, and of course, disability.</p>

                <p>The Body of Knowledge links to the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/equality-act-2010-guidance">UK's primer document on the Equality Act</a>.</p>

                  <p>Specific provisions are made in respect to disability including ensuring accessibility in public transport and education, and anti-discrimination in the workplace. Hiring people can no longer ask questions about disability and health in most cases.</p>
