            <p><strong>ATTENTION: These are not official testing questions.</strong> </p>
            <p>As part of my studies, I've gone ahead and made many practice questions that I am using for my personal study, using the multiple choice format. I've attempted to set the difficulty of these to be fairly high, and I've attempted to model them around the Recommended Study Activities described in the Body of Knowledge.</p>

            <p>You can either view the questions in web format, or choose to play the little multiple-choice Javascript applet I have created. You must have Javascript enabled in order to start the game.</p>
