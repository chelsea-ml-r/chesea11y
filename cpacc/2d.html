            <h1 id="2d">2D. Built Environment Accessibility</h1>
            <h2>Source: The Body of Knowledge</h2>
            <p>This section emphasizes that the Universal Design principles were designed for the built environment before they were applied to digital environmennts. In built environments, the planning, designing, construction and maintenance are different phases where inclusive principles may be implemented. When we speak of the 'built environments,' we are largely referring to buildings, public spaces, and transportation systems.</p>
            <p>Just as 'shifting left' to incoporate UD in design is less expensive than remediating digital products, the same applies to built environments where retrofitting inaccessible designs is ultimately more expensive than if these prinicples were incoporated in design phase.</p>
            <p>It is common for the 'minimum standards' of national regulations to reflect an 'accomodations' approach over an UD approach. UD is recommended by many countries as a best practice, though it is not a requirement for compliance.</p>
      
            <p>Some questions that accessibility for the built environment considers might include:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>How accessible is entrance and exit from this building?</li>
              <li>How accessible is the evacuation plan from this building?</li>
              <li>How safe is this building for Disabled people?</li>
              <li>How accessible are the individual rooms and floorplans of this building?</li>
              <li>How accessible is navigatory information, such as signs?</li>
              <li>How accessible is this transit route?</li>
              <li>Can Disabled people access this means of transport reliably?</li>
            </ul>
      
            <h2>Source: <a href="https://rm.coe.int/CoERMPublicCommonSearchServices/DisplayDCTMContent?documentId=09000016805a2a24">Council of Europe, Accessibility: Principles and Guidelines (PDF)</a></h2>
      
            <p>This a pretty dense document from 2004 that sounds like it was translated, likely from the French. The source establishes that with a raising population of Disabled people, it is for the better of society that accessibility not hinder Disabled people from enjoying their human rights. Six focus areas are named as composing a larger accessibility plan for Europe: integrated solutions, building for everyone, accessibility charts for existing areas, monitoring, integration in architectural education, and international co-operation.</p>
