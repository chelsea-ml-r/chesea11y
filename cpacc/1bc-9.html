        Demographics
      </h2>
      <p>Anxiety disorder is the most prevalent disorder: 284 million people globally experienced it in 2017. The prevalence of anxiety disorder by country varies from 2.5 to 7 percent.</p>
      <p>Bipolar disorder was experienced by 19 million people worldwide in 2019.</p>
      <p>Schizophrenia, a psychotic disorder, affects about 24 million people (1 in 300) worldwide.</p>

      <p>The three facts above are testable on the CPACC exam. But another important fact is that in 2019, 1 in 8 people had a diagnosed mental disorder, and that rose post-pandemic. There are a lot of us.</p>

      <h2 id="2">Medical Details</h2>
      <p>Psychological disabilities include anxiety disorders, mood disorders, and psychotic disorders. They interfere with mental health and affect a person's thoughts and behaviour.</p>
      <p>According to the <a href="https://www.parentcenterhub.org/emotionaldisturbance/">Center for Parent Information and Resources,</a> (source linked in the BoK) psychological disabilities are characterized by 'emotional disturbances' including behaviour such as hyperactivity, aggression or self-injury, withdrawl, immaturity, and learning difficulty.</p>


      <p>Anxiety disorders include GAD (generalized anxiety disorder), panic disorder, social anxiety disorder, and phobia disorders. While everyone experiences anxiety, not everyone has an anxiety disorder.</p>
      <p>According to the <a href="https://www.parentcenterhub.org/emotionaldisturbance/">Center for Parent Information and Resources,</a>  (source linked in the BoK) anxiety is highly treatable, but unfortunately less than 40% receive treatment.</p>
      <h3>Generalized Anxiety Disorder</h3>
      <p>A person with GAD is on edge all the time for no particular logical reason. They might be easily fatigued, have sleep problems, physical ailments, and difficulty concentration.</p>
      <p>According to <a href="https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/publications/generalized-anxiety-disorder-gad">the National Institute of Mental Health</a> (source linked in the BoK), symptoms can fluctuate. People with GAD often know that their anxiety is irrational and is interfering with their health, job security, and daily activities. GAD is treated with therapy and use of antidepressant and/or anti-anxiety medication. GAD is more common in women, and creeps up on you. While it can be present in childhood, for many, it starts at age 30.</p>
      <h3>Panic Disorder</h3>
      <p>A panic attack is characterized by physical symptoms like a racinng heart rate, sweating, trembling, and chest pain. These are accompanied by thoughts of impending doom and loss of control. Panic disorder is basically when you experience these frequently and unexpectedly.</p>
      <p>According to <a href="https://www.samhsa.gov/mental-health/anxiety-disorders">Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services and Administration</a> (a source linked in the BoK), a person with panic disorder might only experience these attacks occasionally. It's all about the extent to which it interferes with daily life. If the person worries about having these attacks again to the point of altering their behaviour (such as avoiding a place where they had a panic attack in the past), they might still get diagnosed.</p>
      <p>According to <a href="https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/publications/generalized-anxiety-disorder-gad">the National Institute of Mental Health</a> (source linked in the BoK), panic disorder occurs more frequently in woman than in men and can be treated with medication like SSRIs and beta blockers.</p>
      <h3>Social Anxiety Disorder</h3>
      <p>This is a debilitating fear of social situations. The person may feel self-conscious, embarassed or awkward in the prescence of other people. They also may carry themselves with a rigid body position, make little eye contact, or speak with a very soft voice.</p>

      <p>According to <a href="https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/publications/social-anxiety-disorder-more-than-just-shyness">the National Institute of mental health</a> (source linked in the BoK), some people with Social Anxiety Disorder only experience it during public performances.</p>

      <p>Anxiety disorders can be contrasted by mood disorders, the most prevalent of which are depression, bipolar disorder, seasonal affective disorder, and self-harm.</p>

      <h3>Bipolar Disorder</h3>
      <p>This is where a person oscillates between periods of depression and mania. Each episode may last for weeks. In a state of depression, a person may have difficulty concentrating, lack energy, and feel down. In a state of mania, a person might make risky decisions, make ambitious plans, feel light, and be easily distracted or agitated.</p>
      <p>Both of the episodes are characterized by delusional, disturbed or illogical thinking.</p>
      <p>According to <a href="https://www.nhs.uk/mental-health/conditions/bipolar-disorder/">the NHS' entry on bipolar disorder</a> which is linked in the BoK, there are also periods where the mood is stable and symptoms are apparently in check.</p>

      <h3>Psychotic Disorders</h3>
      <p>Pyschotic symptoms, where a person might perceive or think things that are not true, are present in bipolar disorder. But the classic psychotic disorder where the primary characterization is by such hallucinations and delusions is known as schizophrenia.</p>
      <p>Persons with schizophrenia also may have trouble making decisions and sustaining attention.</p>
      <p>According to <a href="https://medlineplus.gov/schizophrenia.html">the National Library of Medicine</a> (a source in the BoK), people with schizophrenia also might have depressive symptoms and feelings of paranoia. It typically develops in young adults, and symptoms in men start earlier than symptoms in women.</p>

      <h2 id="3">Accomodations</h2>
      <p>The barriers that people with psychological disabilities face are exacerbated by structural issues. Mental healthcare has limited availability and isn't generally affordable. Many providers cannot diagnose accurately, not enough support for emotional troubles is providing in the work and school setting. On top of that, the stigma against these us is quite high.</p>
      <p>In terms of assistive technologies that help alleviate some of these symptoms, memory aids, text-to-speech software and reminder devices can help cut through the cognitive fog. Voice recognition can help with task completion, and emotional regulation apps can help when emotional disturbances arise.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://askjan.org/disabilities/Anxiety-Disorder.cfm">Job Accomodation Network</a> suggests a myriad of different tweaks to process and technologies that can support people with anxiety, but I think their advice applies across most mental conditions, even extending to cognitive conditions. This isn't explicitly linked to from the Body of Knowledge, but it is linked to from <a href="https://guides.library.illinois.edu/c.php?g=498026&p=3409717">the University of Illinois Guide to Common Assistive Technologies for Anxiety Disorders,</a> which is a linked resource.</p>
      <p>The Job Accomodation Network suggests sensory management and regulation tools like white noise machines, fidget toys, noise cancelling earbuds, soundproof panelling. They also suggests simulated skylights and windows, sun boxes and lights, and sun simulating desk lamps (helpful primarily for folks with seasonal affective depression)</p>
