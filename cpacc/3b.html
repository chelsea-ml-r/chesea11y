            <h2 id="eu">EU Charter of Fundamental Rights</h2>
            <h3>Source: Body of Knowledge</h3>

      <p>Before discussion of the charter itself, there is a short review of what preceeded its adoption in 2000. Fifty years earlier, the European Convention on Human Rights (the ECHR) formed the European Court of Human Rights as a protection mechanism that any European could use if they felt their civil and political rights were being violated. In 1961, the European Social charter extended these to fundamental social and economic rights; it also names ability status specifically as a point which could not be discriminated against.</p>

      <p>In light of these two predecessors, the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union (2000) set to collate and provide consistency to all EU member states. It is based on its two predecessors, alongside rights within specific constitutional traditions of some EU member states, the Community Charter of Fundamental Social Rights of Workers, and other international conventions that the EU or member states were accountable to. The Treaty of Lisbon made the charter legally binding in 2009.</p>

      <p>Article 26 recognizes the right to community living for people with disabilities. Article 21 prohibits discrimination on various things, including 'genetic features,' 'disability,' and 'age.'</p>

      <p>Reading the full text of the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights, here are other articles that I view as being relevant to the lives of Disabled people:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Article 34, which guarantees social security benefits and social services in the case of illness, industrial accidents, and dependency. It also recognizes a right to social and housing assistance.</li>
        <li>Article 35, which guarantees the right to medical treatmennt, as well as preventative health care.</li>
        <li>Article 3, which discusses free and informed consent for medical procedures and research, the prohibition of eugenic practices, and the prohibition of making the human body a source of financial gain.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>I actually had to go hunting for this link, and when I finally found it the top of the page gives a warning reading 'This Charter no longer applies to the UK.'</p>
      <p>Material here is very similar to that found in the Body of Knowledge. We also get some more clarification on the difference between the Convention and the Charter.</p>

      <p>The authors also suggest that the Charter could be viewed as a larger framework of which the Convention forms only a part. Indeed, they operate within two different apparatuses-- after the UK withdrew from the EU, the Convention remained relevant while the Charter no longer was applicable.</p>
      <p>Additionally, an advisory body called the European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights, or the FRA, provides advice regarding the charter to EU Member States and institutions.</p>

      <h3>Source: Council of Europe, <a href="https://www.coe.int/en/web/european-social-charter">The European Social Charter</a></h3>

      <p>Note that this section is entirely regarding the European Social Charter, not to be mistaken with the European Union Charter of Fundamental Human Rights.</p>

      <p>At the section titled 'The Charter at a Glance,' we are introduced to the Social charter as the counterpart of the European convention. Protecting social and eceonomic rights, the Charter places special attention on those it calls 'vulnerable persons:' old adults, children, Disabled people, and migrants. It also calls itself the <strong>Social Constitution of Europe</strong>.</p> 
      <p>Sidenote: Interesting to contrast this attitude towards the attitude presented in the Body of Knowledge, which is very much pro-EU Charter and writes off the Social Charter as being of an older era.</p>

      <p>In the section, <a href="https://www.coe.int/en/web/european-social-charter/-european-social-charter-and-european-convention-on-human-rights">European Social Charter and European Convention on Human Rights</a>, we get an absolutely granular discussion of how the Charter and Convention work together. Where there is overlap, the Charter tends to be more specific. To give a very banal example, the Convention grants the right to marry and then the Charter will ensure equality between spouses. Freedom of assembly and association is covered under the Convention, while the Charter identifies specific obligations and rights specific to trade unions.</p>
      <p>Also note that while the Charter was taken up in 1961, an Additional Protocol was released in 1988, and the Revised Charter was adopted in 1996. It seems that all three of these things kinda comprise the 'Social Charter,' when that term is employed generically.</p>

      <p>In the section, <a href="https://www.coe.int/en/web/european-social-charter/european-social-charter-and-european-union-law">European Social Charter and EU Law</a>, we learn that there is no uniformity amongst EU members when it comes to whether they have signed onto the Social Charter and its iterations of 1961, 1988, and 1996. All EU members are of course, signatories to things like the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights, and the laws of EU itself has basically covered all of what the Social Charter did, "albeit with some differences of both form and substance." The section seems to conclude saying that it would be nice if there was more uniformity, almost mourning the fact that the EU laws have superceded it on many fronts.</p>
