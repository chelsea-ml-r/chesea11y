            <h1>3D. Domain Level</h1>
            <p>3D covers two kinds of laws at the level of domain: Domain-Specific Laws, and Procurement laws.</p>
            <h2>Domain-Specific Laws</h2>
            <p>There's six of them, three are American and three are of the EU.</p>
            <h3>21st Century Communications and Video Accessibility Act (CVAA)</h3>
            <p>Regulatory body: US Federal Communications Commission</p>
            <p>Year: 2010</p>
      
            <p>This applies to communications technology and broadcasting. Various accessibility legislations have been in place for these domains, but the laws were designed with older technology in mind. The 21st Century CVAA takes a lot of those early accessibility things and brings them in line to modern technology.</p>
      
            <h3>Air Carrier Access Act</h3>
            <p>Regulatory body: US Department of Transporation</p>
            <p>Year: 1986</p>
            <p>Applying to flights of US airlines and flights to and from the US by foreign airlines. It's an anti-discriminatory measure defining rights of Disabled passengers and obligations of airlines.</p>
            <p>It's heartbreaking to read this just because of how horrible shit is right now for wheelchair users. Airlines break wheelchairs all the time and those things are so costly. It's like breaking people's legs. It's unacceptable, and there should be steep penalties, but those don't exist. Even with all these provisions, it's anedquate. It no wonder that there have been multiple moves to try to ammend this act. Such as the proposed ammendment below:</p>
      
            <h3>Air Carrier Access Amendments Act (Proposed)</h3>
            <p>Proposing body: US Congress</p>
            <p>Year: Introduced 2017, never passed</p>
            <p>The Body of Knowledge fucks up by never specifying that this act was never passed. It's misleading. The main thing for the Amendments act proposed was the introduction was to clarify several obligations and provide remedies that Disabled passenger could use to actually get some enforcement out of the act. </p>
      
            <p>Let us now turn to the EU.</p>
      
            <h3>Audiovisual Media Services Directive (AVMSD)</h3>
            <p>Regulatory body: European Union</p>
            <p>Year: 2010</p>
            <p>Applies to traditional TV broadcasts,as well as on-demand services. This is not just an accessibility law, it also governs promotion of European works, hate speech and protection of minors. On the accessibility side, the AVMSD requires that these services are made progressively more accessible through proportionate measures.</p>
      
            <h3>European Electronics Communications Code</h3>
            <p>Regulatory body: European Union</p>
            <p>Year: 2018</p>
            <p>As the AVMSD wasn't a specifically accessibility-focused document, neither is the EECC. It applies to communication through traditional (calls, SMS), and web-based services. Relevant to our study is requires that services information are provided in accessible formats, and that emergency services, hotlines, missing children helplines, are all equally accessible to persons with disabilities.</p>
      
            <h3>Regulation on electronic identification and trust services (eIDAS)</h3>
            <p>Regulatory body: European Union</p>
            <p>Year: 2014</p>
            <p>This governs digital transctions that require electronic signatures. As with the other documents, this is a general regulation and not accessibility-specific, but it does have accessibility baked into it. These services are required to be accessible to people with disabilities.</p>
