            <h2>100 Hours of A11Y</h2>

            <p>I spent about one hundred hours studying to become a Certified Professional in Accessibility Core Competencies with the International Association of Accessibility Professionals from November 12 of 2024 to February 6 of 2025.</p>
            <p>This section of my website, which houses over fifty thousand words of <a href="#notes">notes</a>, <a href="#tools">quizzes</a>, <a href="#reflections">reflections</a>, and mnemonics will hopefully be useful to you, a prospective test-taker.</p>
            <p>On March 31, 2025, I received my results: I scored above average on all three domains, and my scaled score was 775 out of 800.</p>
            <p>Please see the <a href="#disclaimers">disclaimers</a> I have before utilizing any of the resources on this site.</p>

            <h3>Further Reading</h3>
            <p>If you've completed Domains 1, 2, and 3, the work isn't over. The back of the BoK features a list of additional readings. I went through all of them and made notes. Read along with me! <a href="further-reading.html">Further Readings Notes</a>.</p>


            <h2 id="disclaimers">Important Disclaimers</h2>
            <p>I created this portal prior to taking the exam on February 6. Here's what I edited after taking the exam:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Spelling and grammar fixes for all posts.</li>
                <li>'Logistics' article.</li>
                <li>Interactivity for Legislation page.</li>
                <li>Reflection page.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The multiple choice questions hosted on this study guide were written entirely by me with no knowledge of what the actual exam contained. They are not official exam questions and any resemblance to the actual test questions is purely incidental.
            </p>
            <p>There may be erroneous information presented in this study guide. Always refer to the BoK for accurate information.</p>
