            <h2 id="udhr">Universal Declaration of Human Rights</h2>
            <h3>Source: Body of Knowledge</h3>


      <p>First, we learn about three approaches to addressing the rights of Disabled people through legislation. </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Legislation grants the rights.</li>
        <li>Legislation prohibits discrimination against disability.</li>
        <li>Legislation addresses the rights directly.</li>        
      </ul>

      <p>We take a walk through history, through three documents that mirror these three approaches.</p>

      <p>It's 1948 and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights is passed. Disabled people are not one of the groups protected in this document.</p>

      <p>The UDHR proclaims civil, cultural, economic, political and social rights to be for all peoples and provides the basis for other international standards, notably the 2006 Convention.</p>

      <p>It's 1975 and the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Disabled Persons is passed. As a declaration (as opposed to a Convention), it can only provide recommendations.</p>

      <p>While the Declaration asserts the need for Disabled people to be protected against discriminatory treatment and promotes their integration into all facets of society, it accepts that not all countries can presently afford to devote resources beyond 'limited efforts' to achieve this vision.</p>

      <p>It's 2006 and the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities finally provides a legally beinding convention.</p>
      <h3>Source: <a href="https://www.un.org/en/about-us/universal-declaration-of-human-rights">Universal Declaration of Human Rights</a></h3>
      <h4>The Document</h4>
      <p>More tiny little details about the document itself:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>When? 10 December 1948</li>
        <li>Where? Paris.</li>
        <li>Translated into 500+ languages.</li>
        <li>Paved the way for 70+ human rights treaties.</li>
        <li>What? General Assembly Resolution 217 A</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Now it does feel silly to memorize all 30 points of this article. So I'm going to narrow it down to just the super relevant things.</p>

      <h4>UDHR Articles 1-2</h4>
      <p>I present an abbreviated form of these articles here:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Article 1: All humans are born free and equal in dignity and rights.
        </li>
        <li>
          Article 2: Rights and freedoms apply to all, without discrimination.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>Article 2 explicitly lists a whole bunch of categories that cam't be used as basis for discimination. Disability status is not listed as part of these, though it is implied that the UDHR is not restricted to the categories that it does name.</p>
      <p>The first two articles are the basis for which all the other articles follow; the assertion of inalienable human rights as a new rule of law in the natural order is nothing to scoff at.</p>

      <h4>UDHR Articles 3-30</h4>
      <p>Simultaneously, we should look to see what kind of themes and priorities are reflected across the other 27 articles.</p>

      <p>One prevalent theme is <Strong>'everybody has the right to not get mistreated'</Strong> worded in many different ways: freedom from torture, get a fair trial, be able to get out of bad situations.</p>

      <p>Another theme evolves around <strong>'basic everyday needs and activity'</strong> which include living conditions, work, rest, education, social living, family, and free expression.</p>

      <p>Another theme concerns the <strong>governance</strong> of the nation and international order. On the national level, this addresses things like peaceful assembly, labour unions, participating in government, equal laws. On the global level, it calls for international collaboration to ensure everyone gets access to these rights. </p>

      <h3>Source: <a href="https://www.ohchr.org/en/disabilities">Human Rights of People with Disabilities</a></h3>
      <p>This webpage is attributed to the Office of the High Commissioner and describes what work the UN has done and continues to do to address the human rights of Disabled people.</p>
      <h4>Overview</h4>
      <p>The Office facilitates engagement with this issue at the intergovernmental level and also recruits dialoguing partners from representative organisations of Disabled people. </p><p>The Office promotes awareness, and also ensures Disabled people are seen and considered in greater projects across the whole United Nations apparatus, including with the Sustainable Development Goals. They name the UN Disability Inclusion Strategy as a particular example of this.</p>
      <h4><a href="https://www.ohchr.org/en/disabilities/about-human-rights-persons-disabilities">About the Human Rights of Disabled People</a></h4>
      <p>In this section, we see main points from the Body of Knowledge reflected back at us. The CRPD, 2006 for adoption, 2008 when it came into force, took up the social model and took to articulate the UDHR promise in explicit and pragmatic terms within the disability context.</p>
      <p>But we also see some new and exciting points. The Office acknowledges that disability status interacts with other facets of identity and cirumstances in further disabling ways, especially in developing countries. In addition to this, they describe the CRPD as being more capable of dealing with these more complex cases of discrimination; Disabled women and children are explicitly addressed within the wording of the CRPD. We end with this very poignant quote,</p>

      <blockquote>
        [R]eaching the furthest behind first is the key to leaving no one behind.
      </blockquote>

      <p>This is a very common sentiment within the larger conversation of Disability Studies, especially Disability Justice activism led by queer and trans Disabled BIPOC.</p>
      <p>This small article also might be the first time that we see some material realities of Disabled people acknowledged. Disabled people commonly are confined to institutions, are barred from voting, are unable to have their own property, are forcefully segregated from the mainstream at various levels of society (including within the justice system, don't get me started!) among other things.</p>
      <p>I feel like the whole curriculum would have been better if we started the talk about disability with this, with the history. Not to paint a deficit ideology portrait of disability in general, but true accessibility will never be met as long as basic needs are not met and material conditions don't change. As Certified Accessibility Professionals, shouldn't this be something that we should know?</p>

      <h3>Source: <a href="https://www.ohchr.org/en/instruments-mechanisms/instruments/declaration-rights-disabled-persons">Declaration on the Rights of Disabled Persons</a></h3>

      <p>This is the full text of the Declaration. It's shorter than I had anticipated, and way more interesting than I had anticipated. Here are points I note in reading it.</p>

      <p>They cite a bunch of predecessing declarations, including the Declaration on the Rights of Mentally R******d Persons which feels like it comes out of nowhere. What IS that? Passed in 1971, it echoes a lot of the attitudes towards people with intellectual and/or developmental disabilities and the type of care that should be organized for them up to nearly the present day. It falls to the wayside, just as the DRDP falls to the wayside, because the CRPD is just so much stronger as an instrument of policy making.</p>

      <p>Moving on, we see the little exception that developing countries "can devote only limited efforts" and can therefore be excused from a lot of these things.</p>
      <p>With the caveats and background done, we jump into the declaration itself, which starts off with a fascinating definition of disability. I am drawn to this one. It's a function-based definition where the bar to clear is 'ensuring for oneself the necessities of a normal individual (or social) life' but it's supported by some classic medical-model based, 'as a result of dificiency in physical or mental capabilities.'</p>
      <p>The document doesn't contain the word 'accessibility.' It's slightly present within the phrase 'measures designed to enable them to become as self-reliant as possible,' but it never really addresses the idea of inaccessibility, or the environment being the problem somehow. Instead, assitive technology and interventions on the individual or 'treatment' is the thing that is promised to all Disabled people, which is slightly insidious. It's all under the guise that the rehabilitation is always the right move and the right goal. This simply does not give autonomy to the Disabled person, and it leaves the Disabled people who never get better, either because they can't get better or don't want to get better, out in the dust.</p>
      <p>I think in reading this, it really drives home the fact that there has been significant progress in society's attitude. It's still bad, but it used to be much, much worse. And many people who were raised in eras where the social model was not at all present might still continue to have really outdated beliefs.</p>

      
            <h2 id="crpd">Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities</h2>

        <h3>Source: Body of Knowledge</h3>
      <p>This is the most important document to know about, because in signing onto the CRPD, states parties must actually implement it.</p>
      <p>The language is a bit dense here, so I'll paraphrase from the Body of Knowledge in the style of question-and-answer.</p>

      <dl>
        <dt>
          Through what model does the UNCRPD approach people with disabilities?
        </dt>
        <dd>The UNCRPD follows the movement to shift towards the social model of disability and away from the medical and charity models of disability, as has historically been the case in policy-making.</dd>
        <dt>Broadly speaking, what does the UNCRPD do?</dt>
        <dd>Reaffirming that Disabled people are a category of people with protected rights and freedoms, it makes explicit that extra steps need to be taken in order for Disabled people to enjoy these rights and freedoms. In discussing these extra steps, the UNCRPD talks about how Disabled people need accomodations and how Disabled people may have their rights violated. Fundamentally, the UNCRPD is focused on implementation.</dd>
        <dt>What support does the UNCRPD have?</dt>
        <dd>The UNCRP has very broad support. Over 180 countries/regional unions have ratified it, meaning they have committed to implementing internal policies to achieve the UNCRP's mandate. The UNCRP has been signed by over 160 countries/regional unions (there is overlap between these two groups). The EU is very supportive of the UNCRPD; it signed and ratified as itself, and then all EU member states ratified it individually.</dd>
        <dt>What are ratified states obligated to do?</dt>
        <dd>They are obligated to establish a framework to Promote, Protect, and Monitor the implementation of the CRPD.</dd>
        <dt>What monitors the ratified states parties?</dt>
        <dd>The Committee on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities conducts regular reviews. Non-government bodies can submit to compilation called a 'List of Issues.' When state parties report back, they have to respond to the List of Issues. (The BoK is kind vague about the process here, and I'm having trouble finding resources concerning this).</dd>
        <dt>What does the UNCRPD say about accessibility?</dt>
        <dd>A lot. Accessibility the fifth principle listed in Article 3: General Principles, and the entirety of Article 9 is dedicated to hashing out the nitty-gritty. </dd>
      </dl>

      <p>The authors of the BoK then proceed to lay out the full text Article 9. The spirit of Article 9 basically is as follows: State parties should endeavor to so that all environments that are accessible to the public, whether they are publically or privately funded, whether they are urban or rural, whether they are physical or digital, are also accessible to people with disabilities. They should provide minimum standards and training to get to this point. Additionally, Disabled people should have access to assistive technology and live support (guides, interpreters) that can facilitate access to information, including digital information. Also, in the physical world, Braille signage and plain language signage should be available always.</p>

        <h3>Source: Body of Knowledge</h3>
        <p>The World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) administeries a body of international copyright treaties. For a long time, copyright limitations have prevented accessible formats of texts from being produced easily. The Marrakesh Treaty, adopted on June 27, 2013, provides a copyright exception in service of making the creation of such accessible formats more easy.</p>
