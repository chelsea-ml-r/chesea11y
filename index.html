    <p>Welcome to my site, it's called Chelsea's Accessibility Learning, abbreviated to 'ChelseA11y Learning.' Here, I detail my journey as I dive headfirst into the world of web accessibility. Partially inspired by <a href="https://100daysofa11y.com/">100 Days of A11Y</a>, I abide by the framework of <a href="https://ashleemboyer.com/blog/what-it-means-to-learn-out-loud">"Learning Out Loud."</a> It is coincidentally similar to the <a href="https://github.com/jbranchaud/til">Today I Learned</a> concept.</p>
    <p>Unlike many people interested in this field, I am not transitioning from UX or front-end stuff. I am learning all of this technology from the ground up. If this piques your interest, welcome here!</p>

    <h2>Who</h2>

    <p>I'm Chelsea, an aspiring web accessibility consultant. I have a background in the humanities and a minor in computer science. I like it when people mix up the pronouns they use for me.</p>

    <p>I am Disabled, though not in a way that greatly impacts how I interact with technology. At least, not yet.</p>


    <h2>Why</h2>
    <p>I want to be part of a world that has systems that empowers everyone to realize their full potential. I see web accessibility as a key part of creating that new world.</p>

    <p>We all become Disabled in the end. And when my generation grows old, we will all still be addicted to our phones and to the internet. We need to build all of our internet infrastructure with that endgame in mind.</p>

    <h2>How</h2>
    <p>Generally, I take a two-pronged approach of theory and practice. On the practical side, I look at websites from businesses operating in my city. I evaluate them against WCAG 2.1 and record novel observations along the way. On the theoretical side, I comb through personal blogs written by subject experts and record information new to me.</p>
    <p>Currently, I'm focusing a good 75% of my efforts to studying for the CPACC.</p>

    <h2>About This Site</h2>

    <h3>Accessibility</h3>
    <p>This website should meet WCAG 2.2 Level AA and if it doesn't (and you have the spoons to offer feedback), please <a href="https://mstdn.social/@raacz106">contact me on Fedi</a>.</p>
    <p>Also, let me be vulnerable for a moment.</p>
    <p>I write the HTML entirely by hand in VSCodium and for the life of me, haven't figured out how to make spellcheck work. None of the posts are polished, so poor spelling is one of the biggest accessibility failures that I am aware of on this site. For the same reason, there may be issues with translation.</p>
